# CHAPTER 1 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION 116
 CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY


**116.1 General; when to be issued.**


Prior to occupancy or change of occupancy of a building or structure, a certificate of occupancy shall be obtained in
accordance with this section. The building official shall issue the certificate of occupancy within 5 working days after
approval of the final inspection and when the building or structure or portion thereof is determined to be in compliance
with this code and any pertinent laws or ordinances, or when otherwise entitled.

**Exceptions:**

1. [A certificate of occupancy is not required for an accessory structure as defined in the IRC.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIRC_21)

2. A new certificate of occupancy is not required for an addition to an existing Group R-5 building that already

has a certificate of occupancy.

**116.1.1 Temporary certificate of occupancy.**

Upon the request of a permit holder, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued before the completion of the
work covered by a permit, provided that such portion or portions of a building or structure may be occupied safely prior
to full completion of the building or structure without endangering life or public safety.

**116.2 Contents of certificate.**

A certificate of occupancy shall specify the following:

1. The edition of the USBC under which the permit is issued.

2. [The group classification and occupancy in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch03)

3. [The type of construction as defined in Chapter 6.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch06)

4. If an automatic sprinkler system is provided and whether or not such system was required.

5. Any special stipulations and conditions of the building permit and if any modifications were issued under the


permit, there shall be a notation on the certificate that modifications were issued.

6. [Group R-5 occupancies complying with Section R320.3 of the VRC shall have a notation of compliance with that](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VARC2021P1_Ch03_SecR320.3)

section on the certificate.

**116.3 Suspension or revocation of certificate.**

A certificate of occupancy may be revoked or suspended whenever the building official discovers that such certificate
was issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information, or where there are repeated violations of the USBC after the
certificate has been issued or when requested by the code official under Section 106.6 of the VPMC. The revocation or
suspension shall be in writing and shall state the necessary corrections or conditions for the certificate to be reissued or
[reinstated in accordance with Section 116.3.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01_Sec116.3.1)

**116.3.1 Reissuance or reinstatement of certificate of occupancy.**

When a certificate of occupancy has been revoked or suspended, it shall be reissued or reinstated upon correction of the
specific condition or conditions cited as the cause of the revocation or suspension, and the revocation or suspension of a
certificate of occupancy shall not be used as justification for requiring a building or structure to be subject to a later
edition of the code than that under which such building or structure was initially constructed.


**116.4 When no certificate exists.**


When the local building department does not have a certificate of occupancy for a building or structure, the owner or
_owner’s agent may submit a written request for a certificate to be created. The building official, after receipt of the_
request, shall issue a certificate provided a determination is made that there are no current violations of the VPMC or the
_Virginia Statewide Fire Prevention Code (13VAC5-52) and the occupancy classification of the building or structure has not_
changed. Such buildings and structures shall not be prevented from continued use.

When the local building department has records indicating that a certificate did exist but does not have a copy of the

certificate itself, then the building official may either verify in writing that a certificate did exist or issue a certificate
based upon the records.
