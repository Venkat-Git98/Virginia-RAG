**1810.1.2 Use of existing deep foundation elements.**


_Deep foundation elements left in place where a structure has been demolished shall not be used for the support of new_
construction unless satisfactory evidence is submitted to the building official, which indicates that the elements are sound
and meet the requirements of this code. Such elements shall be load tested or redriven to verify their capacities. The
design load applied to such elements shall be the lowest allowable load as determined by tests or redriving data.


**1810.1.3 Deep foundation elements classified as columns.**


_Deep foundation elements standing unbraced in air, water or fluid soils shall be classified as columns and designed as_
such in accordance with the provisions of this code from their top down to the point where adequate lateral support is
[provided in accordance with Section 1810.2.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1810.2.1)

**Exception: Where the unsupported height to least horizontal dimension of a cast-in-place deep foundation element**
does not exceed three, it shall be permitted to design and construct such an element as a pedestal in accordance with

**1810.3.3.1.1 Driving criteria.**


The allowable compressive load on any driven deep foundation element where determined by the application of an
_approved driving formula shall not exceed 40 tons (356 kN). For allowable loads above 40 tons (356 kN), the wave_
equation method of analysis shall be used to estimate driveability for both driving stresses and net displacement per
[blow at the ultimate load. Allowable loads shall be verified by load tests in accordance with Section 1810.3.3.1.2. The](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1810.3.3.1.2)
formula or wave equation load shall be determined for gravity-drop or power-actuated hammers and the hammer energy
used shall be the maximum consistent with the size, strength and weight of the driven elements. The use of a follower is
permitted only with the approval of the building official. The introduction of fresh hammer cushion or pile cushion material
just prior to final penetration is not permitted.


**1810.3.3.1.2 Load tests.**


Where design compressive loads are greater than those determined using the allowable stresses specified in Section
1810.3.2.6, where the design load for any deep foundation element is in doubt, or where cast-in-place deep foundation
elements have an enlarged base formed either by compacting concrete or by driving a precast base, control test
[elements shall be tested in accordance with ASTM D1143 or ASTM D4945. One element or more shall be load tested in](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdD1143_D1143M_20072013E1)
each area of uniform subsoil conditions. Where required by the building official, additional elements shall be load tested
where necessary to establish the safe design capacity. The resulting allowable _loads shall not be more than one-half of_
the ultimate axial load capacity of the test element as assessed by one of the published methods listed in Section
1810.3.3.1.3 with consideration for the test type, duration and subsoil. The ultimate axial load capacity shall be
determined by a registered design professional with consideration given to tolerable total and differential settlements at
[design load in accordance with Section 1810.2.3. In subsequent installation of the balance of deep foundation elements,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1810.2.3)
all elements shall be deemed to have a supporting capacity equal to that of the control element where such elements are
of the same type, size and relative length as the test element; are installed using the same or comparable methods and
equipment as the test element; are installed in similar subsoil conditions as the test element; and, for driven elements,
where the rate of penetration (for example, net displacement per blow) of such elements is equal to or less than that of
the test element driven with the same hammer through a comparable driving distance.


**1810.3.3.1.3 Load test evaluation methods.**

It shall be permitted to evaluate load tests of deep foundation elements using any of the following methods:

1. Davisson Offset Limit.

2. Brinch-Hansen 90-percent Criterion.

**1810.3.3.1.4 Allowable shaft resistance.**


The assumed shaft resistance developed by any uncased cast-in-place deep foundation element shall not exceed one[sixth of the bearing value of the soil material at minimum depth as set forth in Table 1806.2, up to 500 psf (24 kPa),](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1806.2_Tbl1806.2)
unless a greater value is allowed by the building official on the basis of a geotechnical investigation as specified in
[Section 1803 or a greater value is substantiated by a load test in accordance with Section 1810.3.3.1.2. Shaft resistance](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1803)
and end-bearing resistance shall not be assumed to act simultaneously unless determined by a geotechnical investigation
[in accordance with Section 1803.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1803)


**1810.3.3.1.5 Uplift capacity of a single deep foundation element.**


Where required by the design, the uplift capacity of a single deep foundation element shall be determined by an
_approved method of analysis based on a minimum factor of safety of three or by load tests conducted in accordance with_
[ASTM D3689. The maximum allowable uplift load shall not exceed the ultimate load capacity as determined in Section](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdD3689_D3698M_072013E1)
[1810.3.3.1.2, using the results of load tests conducted in accordance with ASTM D3689, divided by a factor of safety of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdD3689_D3698M_072013E1)
two.

**Exception: Where uplift is due to wind or seismic loading, the minimum factor of safety shall be two where capacity**
is determined by an analysis and one and one-half where capacity is determined by load tests.


**1810.3.3.1.6 Allowable uplift load of grouped deep foundation elements.**


For grouped deep foundation elements subjected to uplift, the allowable uplift load for the group shall be calculated by a
generally accepted method of analysis. Where the deep foundation elements in the group are placed at a center-to-center
spacing less than three times the least horizontal dimension of the largest single element, the allowable uplift load for the
group is permitted to be calculated as the lesser of:

1. The proposed individual allowable uplift load times the number of elements in the group.

2. Two-thirds of the effective weight of the group and the soil contained within a block defined by the perimeter of

**1810.3.3.1.7 Load-bearing capacity.**

_Deep foundation elements shall develop ultimate load capacities of not less than twice the design working loads in the_
designated load-bearing layers. Analysis shall show that soil layers underlying the designated load-bearing layers do not
cause the load-bearing capacity safety factor to be less than two.

**1810.3.3.1.8 Bent deep foundation elements.**

The load-bearing capacity of deep foundation elements discovered to have a sharp or sweeping bend shall be determined
by an approved method of analysis or by load testing a representative element.

**1810.3.3.1.9 Helical piles.**


The allowable axial design load, Pa, of helical piles shall be determined as follows:

where Pu is the least value of:


**(Equation 18-4)**


1. Base capacity plus shaft resistance of the helical pile. The base capacity is equal to the sum of the areas of the

helical bearing plates times the ultimate bearing capacity of the soil or rock comprising the bearing stratum. The
shaft resistance is equal to the area of the shaft above the uppermost helical bearing plate times the ultimate skin
resistance.


2. Ultimate capacity determined from well-documented correlations with installation torque.

3. [Ultimate capacity determined from load tests where required by Section 1810.3.3.1.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1810.3.3.1.2)

adjacent structures. Element tips shall be advanced below the preexcavated depth until the required resistance or
penetration is obtained.


**1810.4.5 Vibratory driving.**


Vibratory drivers shall only be used to install deep foundation elements where the element load capacity is verified by
[load tests in accordance with Section 1810.3.3.1.2. The installation of production elements shall be controlled according](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1810.3.3.1.2)
to power consumption, rate of penetration or other approved means that ensure element capacities equal or exceed
those of the test elements.


**Exceptions:**

1. [The pile installation is completed by driving with an impact hammer in accordance with Section 1810.3.3.1.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1810.3.3.1.1)

develop the required capacity and penetration, or the capacity of the element shall be verified by load tests in
[accordance with Section 1810.3.3.1.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1810.3.3.1.2)


**1810.4.7 Enlarged base cast-in-place elements.**


Enlarged bases for cast-in-place deep foundation elements formed by compacting concrete or by driving a precast base
shall be formed in or driven into granular soils. Such elements shall be constructed in the same manner as successful
prototype test elements driven for the project. Shafts extending through peat or other organic soil shall be encased in a
permanent steel casing. Where a cased shaft is used, the shaft shall be adequately reinforced to resist column action or
the annular space around the shaft shall be filled sufficiently to reestablish lateral support by the soil. Where heave
occurs, the element shall be replaced unless it is demonstrated that the element is undamaged and capable of carrying
twice its design load.


**1810.4.8 Hollow-stem augered, cast-in-place elements.**


Where concrete or grout is placed by pumping through a hollow-stem auger, the auger shall be permitted to rotate in a
clockwise direction during withdrawal. As the auger is withdrawn at a steady rate or in increments not to exceed 1 foot
(305 mm), concreting or grouting pumping pressures shall be measured and maintained high enough at all times to
offset hydrostatic and lateral earth pressures. Concrete or grout volumes shall be measured to ensure that the volume of
concrete or grout placed in each element is equal to or greater than the theoretical volume of the hole created by the
auger. Where the installation process of any element is interrupted or a loss of concreting or grouting pressure occurs,
the element shall be redrilled to 5 feet (1524 mm) below the elevation of the tip of the auger when the installation was
interrupted or concrete or grout pressure was lost and reformed. Augered cast-in-place elements shall not be installed
within six diameters center to center of an element filled with concrete or grout less than 12 hours old, unless approved
by the building official. If the concrete or grout level in any completed element drops due to installation of an adjacent
element, the element shall be replaced.


**1810.4.9 Socketed drilled shafts.**

filling with concrete. Steel cores shall be bedded in cement grout at the base of the rock socket.


**1810.4.10 Micropiles.**


_Micropile deep foundation elements shall be permitted to be formed in holes advanced by rotary or percussive drilling_
methods, with or without casing. The elements shall be grouted with a fluid cement grout. The grout shall be pumped
through a tremie pipe extending to the bottom of the element until grout of suitable quality returns at the top of the
element. The following requirements apply to specific installation methods:

1. For micropiles grouted inside a temporary casing, the reinforcing bars shall be inserted prior to withdrawal of the

casing. The casing shall be withdrawn in a controlled manner with the grout level maintained at the top of the
element to ensure that the grout completely fills the drill hole. During withdrawal of the casing, the grout level inside
the casing shall be monitored to verify that the flow of grout inside the casing is not obstructed.
