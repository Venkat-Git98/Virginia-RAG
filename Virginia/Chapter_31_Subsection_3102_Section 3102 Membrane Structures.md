**3102.3.1 Membrane and interior liner material.**


[Membranes and interior liners shall be either noncombustible as set forth in Section 703.3 or meet the fire propagation](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec703.3)
performance criteria of Test Method 1 or Test Method 2, as appropriate, of [NFPA 701 and the manufacturer’s test](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd701_19)
protocol.

**Exception: Plastic less than 20 mil (0.5 mm) in thickness used in greenhouses, where occupancy by the general**
public is not authorized, and for aquaculture pond covers is not required to meet the fire propagation performance
[criteria of Test Method 1 or Test Method 2, as appropriate, of NFPA 701.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd701_19)


**3102.4 Allowable floor areas.**

[The area of a membrane structure shall not exceed the limitations specified in Section 506.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch05_Sec506)

**3102.5 Maximum height.**


Membrane structures shall not exceed one story nor shall such structures exceed the height limitations in feet specified in
[Section 504.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch05_Sec504.3)

**Exception: Noncombustible membrane structures serving as roofs only.**

**3102.6 Mixed construction.**

Membrane structures shall be permitted to be utilized as specified in this section as a portion of buildings of other types
of construction. Height and area limits shall be as specified for the type of construction and occupancy of the building.

**3102.6.1 Noncombustible membrane.**

A noncombustible membrane shall be permitted for use as the roof or as a skylight of any building or atrium of a building
of any type of construction provided that the membrane is not less than 20 feet (6096 mm) above any floor, balcony or
gallery.

**3102.6.1.1 Membrane.**

A membrane meeting the fire propagation performance criteria of Test Method 1 or Test Method 2, as appropriate, of
[NFPA 701 shall be permitted to be used as the roof or as a skylight on buildings of Type IIB, III, IV-HT and V construction,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd701_19)
provided that the membrane is not less than 20 feet (6096 mm) above any floor, balcony or gallery.

**3102.7 Engineering design.**

The structure shall be designed and constructed to sustain dead loads; _loads due to tension or inflation; live loads_
[including wind, snow or flood and seismic loads and in accordance with Chapter 16.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16)

**3102.8 Inflation systems.**

_Air-supported and air-inflated structures shall be provided with primary and auxiliary inflation systems to meet the_
[minimum requirements of Sections 3102.8.1 through 3102.8.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch31_Sec3102.8.1)

**3102.8.1 Equipment requirements.**

The inflation system shall consist of one or more blowers and shall include provisions for automatic control to maintain
the required inflation pressures. The system shall be so designed as to prevent overpressurization of the system.

**3102.8.1.1 Auxiliary inflation system.**

In addition to the primary inflation system, in buildings larger than 1,500 square feet (140 m) in area, an auxiliary2
inflation system shall be provided with sufficient capacity to maintain the inflation of the structure in case of primary
system failure. The auxiliary inflation system shall operate automatically when there is a loss of internal pressure and
when the primary blower system becomes inoperative.

**3102.8.1.2 Blower equipment.**

Blower equipment shall meet all of the following requirements:

1. Blowers shall be powered by continuous-rated motors at the maximum power required for any flow condition as

required by the structural design.

2. Blowers shall be provided with inlet screens, belt guards and other protective devices as required by the building

_official to provide protection from injury._

3. Blowers shall be housed within a weather protecting structure.

4. Blowers shall be equipped with backdraft check dampers to minimize air loss when inoperative.

5. Blower inlets shall be located to provide protection from air contamination. The location of inlets shall be


_approved._

**3102.8.2 Standby power.**


Wherever an auxiliary inflation system is required, an approved standby power-generating system shall be provided. The
system shall be equipped with a suitable means for automatically starting the generator set upon failure of the normal
electrical service and for automatic transfer and operation of all of the required electrical functions at full power within
60 seconds of such service failure. Standby power shall be capable of operating independently for not less than 4 hours.


**3102.8.3 Support provisions.**


A system capable of supporting the membrane in the event of deflation shall be provided for in air-supported and air_inflated structures having an occupant load of 50 or more or where covering a swimming pool regardless of occupant_
_load. The support system shall be capable of maintaining membrane structures used as a roof for Type I construction not_
less than 20 feet (6096 mm) above floor or seating areas. The support system shall be capable of maintaining other
membranes not less than 7 feet (2134 mm) above the floor, seating area or surface of the water.
