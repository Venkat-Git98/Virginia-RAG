# APPENDIX G FLOOD-RESISTANT CONSTRUCTION

 SECTION G104
 POWERS AND DUTIES

**G104.1 Permit applications.**

All applications for permits shall comply with the following:


1. The floodplain administrator shall review all permit applications to determine whether proposed development is


[located in flood hazard areas established in Section G103.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_AppxG_SecG103.2)


2. Where a proposed development site is in a flood hazard area, all development to which this appendix is

[applicable as specified in Section G103.1 shall be designed and constructed with methods, practices and materials](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_AppxG_SecG103.1)
[that minimize flood damage and that are in accordance with this code and ASCE 24.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd24_14)

**G104.2 Other permits.**

It shall be the responsibility of the floodplain administrator to ensure that approval of a proposed development shall not
be given until proof that necessary permits have been granted by federal or state agencies having jurisdiction over such
development.


**G104.3 Determination of design flood elevations.**


If design flood elevations are not specified, the floodplain administrator is authorized to require the applicant to meet one
of the following:

1. Obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available from a federal, state or other source.

2. Determine the design flood elevation in accordance with accepted hydrologic and hydraulic engineering

techniques. Such analyses shall be performed and sealed by a registered design professional. Studies, analyses and
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow review and approval by the floodplain administrator. The
accuracy of data submitted for such determination shall be the responsibility of the applicant.

**G104.4 Activities in riverine flood hazard areas.**

In riverine flood hazard areas where design flood elevations are specified but floodways have not been designated, the
floodplain administrator shall not permit any new construction, substantial improvement or other development, including
fill, unless the applicant submits an engineering analysis prepared by a registered design professional, demonstrating
that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated flood
_hazard area encroachment, will not increase the design flood elevation more than 1 foot (305 mm) at any point within the_
community.

**G104.5 Floodway encroachment.**

Prior to issuing a permit for any floodway encroachment, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other development or land-disturbing activity, the floodplain administrator shall require submission of a certification,
prepared by a registered design professional, along with supporting technical data, demonstrating that such development
will not cause any increase of the base flood level.

**G104.5.1 Floodway revisions.**

A _floodway encroachment that increases the level of the base flood is authorized if the applicant has applied for a_
conditional Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) revision and has received the approval of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).


**G104.6 Watercourse alteration.**


Prior to issuing a permit for any alteration or relocation of any watercourse, the floodplain administrator shall require the
applicant to provide notification of the proposal to the appropriate authorities of all adjacent government jurisdictions, as
well as appropriate state agencies. A copy of the notification shall be maintained in the permit records and submitted to
FEMA.

**G104.6.1 Engineering analysis.**

The floodplain administrator shall require submission of an engineering analysis, prepared by a registered design
_professional, demonstrating that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse will not_
be decreased. Such watercourses shall be maintained in a manner that preserves the channel’s flood-carrying capacity.

**G104.7 Alterations in coastal areas.**

Prior to issuing a permit for any alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands in coastal high-hazard areas and coastal A
zones, the floodplain administrator shall require submission of an engineering analysis, prepared by a registered design
_professional, demonstrating that the proposed alteration will not increase the potential for flood damage._

_Residential Code._

**G104.9 Inspections.**

Development for which a permit under this appendix is required shall be subject to inspection. The floodplain
administrator or the floodplain administrator’s designee shall make, or cause to be made, inspections of all development
in flood hazard areas authorized by issuance of a permit under this appendix.

**G104.10** **Use of changed technical data.**

The floodplain administrator and the applicant shall not use changed flood hazard area boundaries or base flood
elevations for proposed buildings or developments unless the floodplain administrator or applicant has applied for a
conditional Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) revision and has received the approval of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
