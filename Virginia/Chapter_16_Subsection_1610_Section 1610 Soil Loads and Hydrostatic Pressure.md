# CHAPTER 16 STRUCTURAL DESIGN

 SECTION 1610
 SOIL LOADS AND HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE


**1610.1 Lateral pressures.**


Foundation walls and retaining walls shall be designed to resist lateral soil loads from adjacent soil. Soil loads specified in
[Table 1610.1 shall be used as the minimum design lateral soil loads unless determined otherwise by a geotechnical](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1610.1_Tbl1610.1)
[investigation in accordance with Section 1803. Foundation walls and other walls in which horizontal movement is](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1803)
restricted at the top shall be designed for at-rest pressure. Retaining walls free to move and rotate at the top shall be
permitted to be designed for active pressure. Lateral pressure from surcharge loads shall be added to the lateral soil
_load. Lateral pressure shall be increased if expansive soils are present at the site. Foundation walls shall be designed to_
support the weight of the full hydrostatic pressure of undrained backfill unless a drainage system is installed in
[accordance with Sections 1805.4.2 and 1805.4.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1805.4.2)

**Exception: Foundation walls extending not more than 8 feet (2438 mm) below grade and laterally supported at the**
top by flexible diaphragms shall be permitted to be designed for active pressure.

# For SI: 1 pound per square foot per foot of depth = 0.157 kPa/m, 1 foot = 304.8 mm.

 a. Design lateral soil loads are given for moist conditions for the specified soils at
 their optimum densities. Actual field conditions shall govern. Submerged or saturated soil pressures shall include the weight of the buoyant soil plus the hydrostatic loads.

 b. Unsuitable as backfill material.

 c. The definition and classification of soil materials shall be in accordance with ASTM

**1610.2** **Uplift loads on floor and foundations.**

Basement floors, slabs on ground, foundations, and similar approximately horizontal elements below grade shall be
designed to resist uplift loads where applicable. The upward pressure of water shall be taken as the full hydrostatic
pressure applied over the entire area. The hydrostatic load shall be measured from the underside of the element being
[evaluated. The design for upward loads caused by expansive soils shall comply with Section 1808.6.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1808.6)
