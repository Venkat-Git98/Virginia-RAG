 SECTION 2305
 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR
 LATERAL FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEMS


**2305.1 General.**

Structures using wood-frame shear walls or wood-frame diaphragms to resist wind, seismic or other lateral loads shall be
[designed and constructed in accordance with AWC SDPWS and the applicable provisions of Sections 2305,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAWC_RefStdANSI_AWC_SDPWS_2021) [2306 and](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2306)
[2307.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2307)

**2305.1.1 Openings in shear panels.**

Openings in shear panels that materially affect their strength shall be detailed on the plans and shall have their edges
adequately reinforced to transfer all shearing stresses.

**2305.2 Diaphragm deflection.**

[The deflection of wood-frame diaphragms shall be determined in accordance with AWC SDPWS. The deflection (Δdia) of a](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAWC_RefStdANSI_AWC_SDPWS_2021)

blocked wood structural panel diaphragm uniformly fastened throughout with staples is permitted to be calculated in
[accordance with Equation 23-1. If not uniformly fastened, the constant 0.188 (For SI: 1/1627) in the third term shall be](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2305.2_Eq23_1)
modified by an approved method.


For SI: Δdia = 0.052 vL3 / EAW + vL/4 Gt + Len /1627 + ∑(xΔ )/2 c _W_

where:


**(Equation 23-1)**


_A = Area of chord cross section, in square inches (mm ).2_

_E = Modulus of elasticity of diaphragm chords, in pounds per square inch (N/mm2)._


_e = Staple slip, in inches (mm) [see n_ [Table 2305.2(1)].](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2305.2_Tbl2305.2_1)

_[Gt = Panel rigidity through the thickness, in pounds per inch (N/mm) of panel width or depth [see Table 2305.2(2)].](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2305.2_Tbl2305.2_2)_

_L = Diaphragm length (dimension perpendicular to the direction of the applied load), in feet (mm)._

_v = Induced unit shear in pounds per linear foot (plf) (N/mm)._

_W = Diaphragm width [in the direction of applied force, in feet (mm)]._

x = Distance from chord splice to nearest support, in feet (mm).

Δ = Diaphragm chord splice slip at the induced unit shear, in inches (mm).c


Δdia = Maximum mid-span diaphragm deflection determined by elastic analysis, in inches (mm).
