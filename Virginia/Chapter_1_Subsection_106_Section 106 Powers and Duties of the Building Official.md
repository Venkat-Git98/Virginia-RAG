# CHAPTER 1 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION 106
 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BUILDING OFFICIAL

**106.1 Powers and duties, generally.**

The building official shall enforce this code as set out herein and as interpreted by the State Review Board.

**106.2 Delegation of authority.**


The building official may delegate powers and duties except where such authority is limited by the local government.
However, such limitations of authority by the local government are not applicable to the third-party inspector policy
[required by Section 113.7.1 nor shall such limitations of authority by the local government have the effect of altering the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01_Sec113.7.1)
provisions of this code or creating building regulations. When such delegations are made, the building official shall be
responsible for assuring that they are carried out in accordance with the provisions of this code.


**106.3 Issuance of modifications.**


Upon written application by an owner or an owner’s agent, the building official may approve a modification of any
provision of the USBC, provided the spirit and functional intent of the code are observed and public health, welfare and
safety are assured. The decision of the building official concerning a modification shall be made in writing and the
application for a modification and the decision of the building official concerning such modification shall be retained in the
permanent records of the local building department.

**Note: The USBC references nationally recognized model codes and standards. Future amendments to such codes**

and standards are not automatically included in the USBC; however, the building official should give them due
consideration in deciding whether to approve a modification.

**106.3.1 Substantiation of modification.**

The building official may require or may consider a statement from a registered design professional (RDP) or other person
competent in the subject area of the application as to the equivalency of the proposed modification. In addition, the
building official may require the application to include construction documents sealed by an RDP. The building official
may also consider nationally recognized guidelines in deciding whether to approve a modification.

**106.3.2 Use of performance code.**

Compliance with the provisions of a nationally recognized performance code when approved as a modification shall be
considered to constitute compliance with this code. All documents submitted as part of such consideration shall be
retained in the permanent records of the local building department.
