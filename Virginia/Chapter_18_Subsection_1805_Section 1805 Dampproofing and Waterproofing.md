# CHAPTER 18 SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS

 SECTION 1805
 DAMPPROOFING AND WATERPROOFING


**1805.1 General.**


Walls or portions thereof that retain earth and enclose interior spaces and floors below grade shall be waterproofed and
dampproofed in accordance with this section, with the exception of those spaces containing groups other than residential
and institutional where such omission is not detrimental to the building or occupancy.


[Ventilation for crawl spaces shall comply with Section 1202.4.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch12_Sec1202.4)

**1805.1.1 Story above grade plane.**


Where a basement is considered a story above grade plane and the finished ground level adjacent to the basement wall
is below the basement floor elevation for 25 percent or more of the perimeter, the floor and walls shall be dampproofed in
[accordance with Section 1805.2 and a foundation drain shall be installed in accordance with Section 1805.4.2. The](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1805.2)
foundation drain shall be installed around the portion of the perimeter where the basement floor is below ground level.
[The provisions of Sections 1803.5.4, 1805.3 and 1805.4.1 shall not apply in this case.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1803.5.4)


**1805.1.2 Under-floor space.**


The finished ground level of an under-floor space such as a crawl space shall not be located below the bottom of the
footings. Where there is evidence that the ground-water table rises to within 6 inches (152 mm) of the ground level at the
outside building perimeter, or that the surface water does not readily drain from the building site, the ground level of the
under-floor space shall be as high as the outside finished ground level, unless an approved drainage system is provided.
[The provisions of Sections 1803.5.4, 1805.2, 1805.3 and 1805.4 shall not apply in this case.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1803.5.4)

**1805.1.2.1 Flood hazard areas.**

[For buildings and structures in flood hazard areas as established in Section 1612.3, the finished ground level of an under-](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1612.3)
floor space such as a crawl space shall be equal to or higher than the outside finished ground level on one side or more.

**[Exception: Under-floor spaces of Group R-3 buildings that meet the requirements of FEMA TB 11.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromFEMA_RefStdFEMA_TB_11_01)**

**1805.1.3 Ground-water control.**

Where the ground-water table is lowered and maintained at an elevation not less than 6 inches (152 mm) below the
[bottom of the lowest floor, the floor and walls shall be dampproofed in accordance with Section 1805.2. The design of the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1805.2)
system to lower the ground-water table shall be based on accepted principles of engineering that shall consider, but not
necessarily be limited to, permeability of the soil, rate at which water enters the drainage system, rated capacity of
pumps, head against which pumps are to operate and the rated capacity of the disposal area of the system.

**1805.2 Dampproofing.**

[Where hydrostatic pressure will not occur as determined by Section 1803.5.4, floors and walls for other than wood](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1803.5.4)
foundation systems shall be dampproofed in accordance with this section. Wood foundation systems shall be constructed
[in accordance with AWC PWF.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAWC_RefStdANSI_AWC_PWF_2021)

**1805.2.1 Floors.**

[Dampproofing materials for floors shall be installed between the floor and the base course required by Section 1805.4.1,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1805.4.1)
except where a separate floor is provided above a concrete slab.

Where installed beneath the slab, dampproofing shall consist of not less than 6-mil (0.006 inch; 0.152 mm)

polyethylene with joints lapped not less than 6 inches (152 mm), or other approved methods or materials. Where
permitted to be installed on top of the slab, dampproofing shall consist of mopped-on bitumen, not less than 4-mil (0.004
inch; 0.102 mm) polyethylene, or other approved methods or materials. Joints in the membrane shall be lapped and
sealed in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.


**1805.2.2 Walls.**


Dampproofing materials for walls shall be installed on the exterior surface of the wall, and shall extend from the top of
the footing to above ground level.

Dampproofing shall consist of a bituminous material, 3 pounds per square yard (16 N/m ) of acrylic modified cement,2


[1 8/ inch (3.2 mm) coat of surface-bonding mortar complying with ASTM C887, any of the materials permitted for](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdC887_13)


[waterproofing by Section 1805.3.2 or other approved methods or materials.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1805.3.2)

**1805.2.2.1 Surface preparation of walls.**


Prior to application of dampproofing materials on concrete walls, holes and recesses resulting from the removal of form
ties shall be sealed with a bituminous material or other approved methods or materials. Unit masonry walls shall be

**Exception: Parging of unit masonry walls is not required where a material is approved for direct application to the**
masonry.

**1805.3 Waterproofing.**

[Where the ground-water investigation required by Section 1803.5.4 indicates that a hydrostatic pressure condition exists,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1803.5.4)
[and the design does not include a ground-water control system as described in Section 1805.1.3, walls and floors shall be](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1805.1.3)
waterproofed in accordance with this section.

**1805.3.1 Floors.**

Floors required to be waterproofed shall be of concrete and designed and constructed to withstand the hydrostatic
pressures to which the floors will be subjected.

Waterproofing shall be accomplished by placing a membrane of rubberized asphalt, butyl rubber, fully adhered/fully

bonded HDPE or polyolefin composite membrane or not less than 6-mil [0.006 inch (0.152 mm)] polyvinyl chloride with
joints lapped not less than 6 inches (152 mm) or other approved materials under the slab. Joints in the membrane shall be
lapped and sealed in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions.

**1805.3.2 Walls.**

Walls required to be waterproofed shall be of concrete or masonry and shall be designed and constructed to withstand
the hydrostatic pressures and other lateral loads to which the walls will be subjected.

Waterproofing shall be applied from the bottom of the wall to not less than 12 inches (305 mm) above the maximum

[elevation of the ground-water table. The remainder of the wall shall be dampproofed in accordance with Section 1805.2.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1805.2.2)
