Tempered spandrel glass shall be provided with a removable paper marking by the manufacturer.

**2403.2 Glass supports.**


Where one or more sides of any pane of glass are not firmly supported, or are subjected to unusual load conditions,
detailed construction documents, detailed shop drawings and analysis or test data ensuring safe performance for the
specific installation shall be prepared by a registered design professional.


**2403.3 Glass framing.**


To be considered firmly supported, the framing members for each individual pane of glass shall be designed so that the
deflection of the edge of the glass perpendicular to the glass pane does not exceed /1 175 of the glass edge length where

the glass edge length is not more than 13 feet 6 inches (4115 mm), or /1 240 of the glass edge length + / inch (6.4 mm)1 4

where the glass edge length is greater than 13 feet 6 inches (4115 mm), when subjected to the larger of the positive or
[negative load where loads are combined as specified in Section 1605.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1605)

**2403.4 Interior glazed areas.**

Where interior glazing is installed adjacent to a walking surface, the differential deflection of two adjacent unsupported
edges shall be not greater than the thickness of the panels when a force of 50 pounds per linear foot (plf) (730 N/m) is
applied horizontally to one panel at any point up to 42 inches (1067 mm) above the walking surface.


**2403.5 Louvered windows or jalousies.**


Float, wired and patterned glass in louvered windows and jalousies shall be not thinner than nominal /3 16 inch (4.8 mm)
