**Exception: In buildings of Type IIB, IIIB or VB construction, the construction supporting the** _horizontal assembly is not_
required to be fire-resistance rated at the following:


1. _[Horizontal assemblies at the separations of incidental uses as specified by Table 509.1 provided that the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch05_Sec509.1_Tbl509.1)_

**711.2.4 Fire-resistance rating.**

[The fire-resistance rating of horizontal assemblies shall comply with Sections 711.2.4.1 through 711.2.4.6 but shall be not](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec711.2.4.1)
less than that required by the building type of construction.

**711.2.4.1 Separating mixed occupancies.**

Where the horizontal assembly separates mixed occupancies, the assembly shall have a fire-resistance rating of not less
[than that required by Section 508.4 based on the occupancies being separated.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch05_Sec508.4)

**711.2.4.2 Separating fire areas.**

Where the horizontal assembly separates a single occupancy into different fire areas, the assembly shall have a fire_[resistance rating of not less than that required by Section 707.3.10.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec707.3.10)_

**711.2.4.3 Dwelling units and sleeping units.**

_[Horizontal assemblies serving as dwelling or sleeping unit separations in accordance with Section 420.3 shall be not less](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch04_Sec420.3)_
than 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction.

**Exception: Horizontal assemblies separating dwelling units and sleeping units shall be not less than / -hour fire-1 2**
resistance-rated construction in a building of Types IIB, IIIB and VB construction, where the building is equipped
[throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec903.3.1.1)

**711.2.4.4 Separating smoke compartments.**

[Where the horizontal assembly is required to be a smoke barrier, the assembly shall comply with Section 709.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec709)

**711.2.4.5 Separating incidental uses.**

Where the horizontal assembly separates incidental uses from the remainder of the building, the assembly shall have a
_[fire-resistance rating of not less than that required by Section 509.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch05_Sec509)_

**711.2.4.6 Other separations.**

Where a horizontal assembly is required by other sections of this code, the assembly shall have a fire-resistance rating of
not less than that required by that section.

**711.2.5 Ceiling panels.**

Where the weight of lay-in ceiling panels, used as part of fire-resistance-rated floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assemblies, is
not adequate to resist an upward force of 1 pound per square foot (48 Pa), wire or other approved devices shall be
installed above the panels to prevent vertical displacement under such upward force.


**711.2.6 Unusable space.**
