documented experience or training is related in complexity to the same type of special inspection or testing activities for
projects of similar complexity and material qualities. These qualifications are in addition to qualifications specified in
other sections of this code.


The registered design professional in responsible charge and engineers of record involved in the design of the project

are permitted to act as an approved agency and their personnel are permitted to act as special inspectors for the work
designed by them, provided they qualify as special inspectors.
