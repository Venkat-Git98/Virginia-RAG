# CHAPTER 7 FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES

 SECTION 706
 FIRE WALLS


**706.1 General.**


Each portion of a building separated by one or more fire walls shall be considered a separate building. Fire walls shall be
[constructed in accordance with Sections 706.2 through 706.11. The extent and location of such fire walls shall provide a](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec706.2)
complete separation. Where a fire wall separates occupancies that are required to be separated by a fire barrier wall, the
most restrictive requirements of each separation shall apply. _Equipment and systems are permitted to serve multiple_
attached buildings on the same lot where separated by one or more fire walls.

**706.1.1 Party walls.**

Any wall located on a lot line between adjacent buildings, which is used or adapted for joint service between the two
buildings, shall be constructed as a fire wall in accordance with Section 706. Party walls shall be constructed without
openings and shall create separate buildings.

**Exception: Openings in a party wall separating an anchor building and a mall shall be in accordance with Section**
402.4.2.2.1.

**706.2 Structural stability.**

_Fire walls shall be designed and constructed to allow collapse of the structure on either side without collapse of the wall_
[under fire conditions. Fire walls designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA 221 shall be deemed to comply with](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd221_21)
this section.

**[Exception: In Seismic Design Categories D through F, where double fire walls are used in accordance with NFPA 221,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd221_21)**
floor and roof sheathing not exceeding / inch (19.05 mm) thickness shall be permitted to be continuous through the3 4
wall assemblies of light frame construction.

protected by opening protectives having a fire protection rating of not less than / hour.3 4

2. Noncombustible horizontal projecting elements with concealed spaces, provided that a minimum 1-hour fire
resistance-rated wall extends through the concealed space. The projecting element shall be separated from the
building by not less than 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction for a distance on each side of the fire wall
equal to the depth of the projecting element. The wall is not required to extend under the projecting element
where the building exterior wall is not less than 1-hour fire-resistance rated for a distance on each side of the fire
_wall equal to the depth of the projecting element. Openings within such exterior walls shall be protected by_
opening protectives having a fire protection rating of not less than / hour.3 4

3. For combustible horizontal projecting elements with concealed spaces, the fire wall need only extend through

the concealed space to the outer edges of the projecting elements. The exterior wall behind and below the
projecting element shall be of not less than 1-hour fire-resistance-rated construction for a distance not less than
the depth of the projecting elements on both sides of the fire wall. Openings within such exterior walls shall be
protected by opening protectives having a fire protection rating of not less than / hour.3 4


4. Decks and open porches of buildings in Groups R-3 and R-4.

deck or slab, provided that:


2.1. The lower roof assembly within 4 feet (1220 mm) of the wall has not less than a 1-hour fire-resistance

_rating and the entire length and span of supporting elements for the rated roof assembly has a fire-resistance_
_rating of not less than 1 hour._


2.2. Openings in the roof shall not be located within 4 feet (1220 mm) of the fire wall.

2.3. Each building shall be provided with not less than a Class B roof covering.

3. Walls shall be permitted to terminate at the underside of noncombustible roof sheathing, deck or slabs where

both buildings are provided with not less than a Class B roof covering. Openings in the roof shall not be located
within 4 feet (1220 mm) of the fire wall.

4. In buildings of Types III, IV and V construction, walls shall be permitted to terminate at the underside of

combustible roof sheathing or decks, provided that all of the following requirements are met:
