# CHAPTER 1 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION 109
 CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS


**109.1 Submittal of documents.**


Construction documents shall be submitted with the application for a permit. The number of sets of such documents to be
submitted shall be determined by the locality. Construction documents for one-and two-family dwellings may have floor
plans reversed provided an accompanying site plan is approved.

**Exception: Construction documents do not need to be submitted when the building official determines the proposed**
work is of a minor nature.

**Note: Information on the types of construction required to be designed by an RDP is included in the “Related Laws**

Package” available from DHCD.

**109.2 Site plan.**

When determined necessary by the building official, a site plan shall be submitted with the application for a permit. The
site plan shall show to scale the size and location of all proposed construction, including any associated wells, septic
tanks or drain fields. The site plan shall also show to scale the size and location of all existing structures on the site, the
distances from lot lines to all proposed construction, the established street grades and the proposed finished grades.
When determined necessary by the building official, the site plan shall contain the elevation of the lowest floor of any
proposed buildings. The site plan shall also be drawn in accordance with an accurate boundary line survey. When the
application for a permit is for demolition, the site plan shall show all construction to be demolished and the location and
size of all existing structures that are to remain on the site.


**Note: Site plans are generally not necessary for alterations, renovations, repairs or the installation of equipment.**

**109.3 Engineering details.**


When determined necessary by the building official, construction documents shall include adequate detail of the
structural, mechanical, plumbing or electrical components. Adequate detail may include computations, stress diagrams
or other essential technical data and when proposed buildings are more than two stories in height, adequate detail may
specifically be required to include where floor penetrations will be made for pipes, wires, conduits, and other components
of the electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems and how such floor penetrations will be protected to maintain the
required structural integrity or fire-resistance rating, or both. When dry floodproofing is provided, the engineering details
shall include detail of the walls, floors, and flood shields designed to resist floodrelated loads, including the sealing of floor
a n d wall penetrations. All engineered documents, including relevant computations, shall be sealed by the RDP
responsible for the design.


**109.4 Examination of documents.**


The building official shall examine or cause to be examined all construction documents or site plans, or both, within a
reasonable time after filing. If such documents or plans do not comply with the provisions of this code, the permit
applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons, which shall include any adverse construction document review
comments or determinations that additional information or engineering details need to be submitted. The review of
construction documents for new one- and two-family dwellings for determining compliance with the technical provisions
of this code not relating to the site, location or soil conditions associated with the dwellings shall not be required when
identical construction documents for identical dwellings have been previously approved in the same locality under the
same edition of the code and such construction documents are on file with the local building department.


**109.4.1 Expedited construction document review.**


The building official may accept reports from an approved person or agency that the construction documents have been
examined and conform to the requirements of the USBC and may establish requirements for the person or agency
submitting such reports. In addition, where such reports have been submitted, the building official may expedite the
issuance of the permit.


**109.5 Approval of construction documents.**


The approval of construction documents shall be limited to only those items within the scope of the USBC. Either the word
“Approved” shall be stamped on all required sets of approved construction documents or an equivalent endorsement in
writing shall be provided. One set of the approved construction documents shall be retained for the records of the local
_building department and one set shall be kept at the building site and shall be available to the building official at all_
reasonable times.

**109.6 Phased approval.**
