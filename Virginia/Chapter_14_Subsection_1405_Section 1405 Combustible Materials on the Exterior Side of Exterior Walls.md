# CHAPTER 14 EXTERIOR WALLS

 SECTION 1405
 COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS ON
 THE EXTERIOR SIDE OF EXTERIOR WALLS

**1405.1 Combustible exterior wall coverings.**

Combustible exterior wall coverings shall comply with this section.

**[Exception: Plastics complying with Chapter 26.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26)**

**1405.1.1 Types I, II, III and IV construction.**


On buildings of Types I, II, III and IV construction, exterior wall coverings shall be permitted to be constructed of
combustible materials, complying with the following limitations:

1. Combustible exterior wall coverings shall not exceed 10 percent of an exterior wall surface area where the fire

_separation distance is 5 feet (1524 mm) or less._

2. Combustible exterior wall coverings shall be limited to 40 feet (12 192 mm) in height above grade plane.

3. [Combustible exterior wall coverings constructed of fire-retardant-treated wood complying with Section 2303.2 for](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2303.2)

exterior installation shall not be limited in wall surface area where the fire separation distance is 5 feet (1524 mm)
or less and shall be permitted up to 60 feet (18 288 mm) in height above grade plane regardless of the fire
_separation distance._


4. [Wood veneers shall comply with Section 1404.5.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1404.5)

**1405.1.1.1 Ignition resistance.**

[Where permitted by Section 1405.1.1, combustible exterior wall coverings shall be tested in accordance with NFPA 268.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1405.1.1)

**Exceptions:**

1. Wood or wood-based products.

2. Other combustible materials covered with an exterior weather covering, other than vinyl sidings, included in

[and complying with the thickness requirements of Table 1404.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1404.2_Tbl1404.2)

3. Aluminum having a minimum thickness of 0.019 inch (0.48 mm).

**1405.1.1.1.1 Fire separation 5 feet or less.**

Where installed on exterior walls having a fire separation distance of 5 feet (1524 mm) or less, combustible exterior wall
_[coverings shall not exhibit sustained flaming as defined in NFPA 268.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd268_17)_

**1405.1.1.1.2 Fire separation greater than 5 feet.**

For fire separation distances greater than 5 feet (1524 mm), any exterior wall covering shall be permitted that has been
[exposed to a reduced level of incident radiant heat flux in accordance with the NFPA 268 test method without exhibiting](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd268_17)
sustained flaming. The minimum fire separation distance required for the exterior wall covering shall be determined from
[Table 1405.1.1.1.2 based on the maximum tolerable level of incident radiant heat flux that does not cause sustained](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1405.1.1.1.2_Tbl1405.1.1.1.2)
flaming of the exterior wall covering.

**1405.1.2 Location.**

Combustible exterior wall coverings located along the top of exterior walls shall be completely backed up by the exterior
_wall and shall not extend over or above the top of the exterior wall._
