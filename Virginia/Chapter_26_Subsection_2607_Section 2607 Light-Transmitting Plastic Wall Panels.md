# CHAPTER 26 PLASTIC

 SECTION 2607
 LIGHT-TRANSMITTING PLASTIC WALL PANELS


**2607.1 General.**


Light-transmitting plastics shall not be used as wall panels in exterior walls in occupancies in Groups A-l, A-2, H, I-2 and I3. In other groups, light-transmitting plastics shall be permitted to be used as wall panels in exterior walls, provided that
the walls are not required to have a fire-resistance rating and the installation conforms to the requirements of this
section. Such panels shall be erected and anchored on a foundation, waterproofed or otherwise protected from moisture
absorption and sealed with a coat of mastic or other approved waterproof coating. Light-transmitting plastic wall panels
[shall comply with Section 2606.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2606)


**2607.2 Installation.**

_Exterior wall panels installed as provided for herein shall not alter the type of construction classification of the building._

**2607.3 Height limitation.**

Light-transmitting plastics shall not be installed more than 75 feet (22 860 mm) above grade plane.

**2607.4 Area limitation and separation.**


The maximum area of a single wall panel and minimum vertical and horizontal separation requirements for exterior light[transmitting plastic wall panels shall be as provided for in Table 2607.4. The maximum percentage of wall area of any](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2607.4_Tbl2607.4)
_[story in light-transmitting plastic wall panels shall not exceed that indicated in Table 2607.4 or the percentage of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2607.4_Tbl2607.4)_
[unprotected openings permitted by Section 705.8, whichever is smaller.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec705.8)


**Exceptions:**


1. In structures provided with approved flame barriers extending 30 inches (760 mm) beyond the exterior wall in

the plane of the floor, a vertical separation is not required at the floor except that provided by the vertical
thickness of the flame barrier projection.

2. _Veneers of approved weather-resistant light-transmitting plastics used as exterior siding in buildings of Type V_

[construction in compliance with Section 1405.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1405)

3. The area of light-transmitting plastic wall panels in exterior walls of greenhouses shall be exempt from the

[area limitations of Table 2607.4 but shall be limited as required for unprotected openings in accordance with](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2607.4_Tbl2607.4)
