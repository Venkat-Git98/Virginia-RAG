**1807.1.5 Concrete and masonry foundation walls.**

[Concrete and masonry foundation walls shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 19 or 21, as applicable.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch19)

**Exception: Concrete and masonry foundation walls shall be permitted to be designed and constructed in accordance**
[with Section 1807.1.6.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1807.1.6)

**1807.1.6 Prescriptive design of concrete and masonry foundation walls.**

Concrete and masonry foundation walls that are laterally supported at the top and bottom shall be permitted to be
designed and constructed in accordance with this section.

**1807.1.6.1 Foundation wall thickness.**

The thickness of prescriptively designed foundation walls shall be not less than the thickness of the wall supported,
except that foundation walls of not less than 8-inch (203 mm) nominal width shall be permitted to support brick-veneered
[frame walls and 10-inch-wide (254 mm) cavity walls provided that the requirements of Section 1807.1.6.2 or 1807.1.6.3](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1807.1.6.2)
are met.

**1807.1.6.2 Concrete foundation walls.**

Concrete foundation walls shall comply with the following:

1. [The thickness shall comply with the requirements of Table 1807.1.6.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1807.1.6.2_Tbl1807.1.6.2)

with a minimum yield strength of 60,000 pounds per square inch (psi) (414 MPa). Vertical reinforcement with a
minimum yield strength of 40,000 psi (276 MPa) or 50,000 psi (345 MPa) shall be permitted, provided that the same
size bar is used and the spacing shown in the table is reduced by multiplying the spacing by 0.67 or 0.83,
respectively.

3. Vertical reinforcement, where required, shall be placed nearest the inside face of the wall a distance, d, from the

outside face (soil face) of the wall. The distance, d, is equal to the wall thickness, t, minus 1.25 inches (32 mm) plus
one-half the bar diameter, d, [b _d = t - (1.25 + d /2)]. The reinforcement shall be placed within a tolerance of ± /b_ 3 8
inch (9.5 mm) where d is less than or equal to 8 inches (203 mm) or ± / inch (12.7 mm) where d is greater than 81 2
inches (203 mm).

4. [In lieu of the reinforcement shown in Table 1807.1.6.2](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1807.1.6.2_Tbl1807.1.6.2), smaller reinforcing bar sizes with closer spacings that

provide an equivalent cross-sectional area of reinforcement per unit length shall be permitted.

5. Concrete cover for reinforcement measured from the inside face of the wall shall be not less than / inch (19.13 4

mm). Concrete cover for reinforcement measured from the outside face of the wall shall be not less than 1 / inches1 2
(38 mm) for No. 5 bars and smaller, and not less than 2 inches (51 mm) for larger bars.


6. Concrete shall have a specified compressive strength, f′c, of not less than 2,500 psi (17.2 MPa).

**1807.3.1 Limitations.**

The design procedures outlined in this section are subject to the following limitations:

1. The frictional resistance for structural walls and slabs on silts and clays shall be limited to one-half of the normal


force imposed on the soil by the weight of the footing or slab.

2. Posts embedded in earth shall not be used to provide lateral support for structural or nonstructural materials such

as plaster, masonry or concrete unless bracing is provided that develops the limited deflection required.

[Wood poles shall be treated in accordance with AWPA U1 for sawn timber posts (Commodity Specification A, Use](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAWPA_RefStdU1_20)

_A = 2.34 P/(S b).1_

_b = Diameter of round post or footing or diagonal dimension of square post or footing, feet (m)._

_d = Depth of embedment in earth in feet (m) but not over 12 feet (3658 mm) for purpose of computing lateral_
pressure.


_h = Distance in feet (m) from ground surface to point of application of “P.”_

_P = Applied lateral force in pounds (kN)._


_S = Allowable lateral soil-bearing pressure as set forth in 1_ [Section 1806.2 based on a depth of one-third the depth of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1806.2)
