## CHAPTER 23 WOOD

 SECTION 2304
 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS

**2304.1 General.**

[The provisions of this section apply to design methods specified in Section 2302.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2302.1)

**2304.2 Size of structural members.**


Computations to determine the required sizes of members shall be based on the net dimensions (actual sizes) and not
nominal sizes.


**2304.3 Wall framing.**


[The framing of exterior and interior walls shall be in accordance with the provisions specified in Section 2308 unless a specific](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2308)
design is furnished.


**2304.3.1 Bottom plates.**


Studs shall have full bearing on a 2-inch-thick (actual 1 / -inch, 38 mm) or larger plate or sill having a width not less than1 2
equal to the width of the studs.


**2304.3.2 Framing over openings.**


Headers, double joists, trusses or other approved assemblies that are of adequate size to transfer loads to the vertical
members shall be provided over window and door openings in load-bearing walls and partitions.


**2304.3.3 Shrinkage.**


Wood walls and bearing partitions shall not support more than two floors and a roof unless an analysis satisfactory to the
_building official shows that shrinkage of the wood framing will not have adverse effects on the structure or any plumbing,_
electrical or mechanical systems or other equipment installed therein due to excessive shrinkage or differential movements
caused by shrinkage. The analysis shall show that the roof drainage system and the foregoing systems or equipment will not
be adversely affected or, as an alternate, such systems shall be designed to accommodate the differential shrinkage or
movements.


**2304.4 Floor and roof framing.**


[The framing of wood-joisted floors and wood-framed roofs shall be in accordance with the provisions specified in Section 2308](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2308)
unless a specific design is furnished.


**2304.5 Framing around flues and chimneys.**


Combustible framing shall be not less than 2 inches (51 mm), but shall be not less than the distance specified in Sections
[2111 and 2113 and the International Mechanical Code, from flues, chimneys and fireplaces, and 6 inches (152 mm) away](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch21_Sec2113)
from flue openings.


**2304.6 Exterior wall sheathing.**


Wall sheathing on the outside of exterior walls, including gables, and the connection of the sheathing to framing shall be
designed in accordance with the general provisions of this code and shall be capable of resisting wind pressures in
[accordance with Section 1609.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1609)


**2304.6.1 Wood structural panel sheathing.**


Where wood structural panel sheathing is used as the exposed finish on the outside of exterior walls, it shall have an exterior
exposure durability classification. Where wood structural panel sheathing is used elsewhere, but not as the exposed finish, it
shall be of a type manufactured with exterior glue (Exposure 1 or Exterior). Wood structural panel sheathing, connections and
[framing spacing shall be in accordance with Table 2304.6.1 for the applicable wind speed and exposure category where used](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2304.6.1_Tbl2304.6.1)
in enclosed buildings with a mean roof height not greater than 30 feet (9144 mm) and a topographic factor (Kz t) of 1.0.

**2304.9.2 Layup patterns.**


[Lumber decking is permitted to be laid up following one of five standard patterns as defined in Sections 2304.9.2.1](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2304.9.2.1) through

**2304.9.2.1 Simple span pattern.**

All pieces shall be supported on their ends (in other words, by two supports).

**2304.9.2.2 Two-span continuous pattern.**


All pieces shall be supported by three supports, and all end joints shall occur in line on alternating supports. Supporting
members shall be designed to accommodate the load redistribution caused by this pattern.

**2304.9.2.3 Combination simple and two-span continuous pattern.**

Courses in end spans shall be alternating simple-span pattern and two-span continuous pattern. End joints shall be staggered
in adjacent courses and shall bear on supports.

**2304.9.2.4 Cantilevered pieces intermixed pattern.**

The decking shall extend across not fewer than three spans. Pieces in each starter course and every third course shall be
simple span pattern. Pieces in other courses shall be cantilevered over the supports with end joints at alternating quarter or
third points of the spans. Each piece shall bear on one support or more.

**2304.9.2.5 Controlled random pattern.**

The decking shall extend across not fewer than three spans. End joints of pieces within 6 inches (152 mm) of the end joints of
the adjacent pieces in either direction shall be separated by not fewer than two intervening courses. In the end bays, each
piece shall bear on one support or more. Where an end joint occurs in an end bay, the next piece in the same course shall

**2304.10.1** **Connection fire-resistance rating.**

_Fire-resistance ratings for connections in Type IV-A, IV-B, or IV-C construction shall be determined by one of the following:_

1. [Testing in accordance with Section 703.2 where the connection is part of the fire resistance test.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec703.2)

2. Engineering analysis that demonstrates that the temperature rise at any portion of the connection is limited to an

average temperature rise of 250°F (139°C), and a maximum temperature rise of 325°F (181°C), for a time corresponding
to the required fire-resistance rating of the structural element being connected. For the purposes of this analysis, the
connection includes connectors, fasteners, and portions of wood members included in the structural design of the
connection.


**2304.10.2 Fastener requirements.**
