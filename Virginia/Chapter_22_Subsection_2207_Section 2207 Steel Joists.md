**2207.1 General.**


[The design, manufacture and use of openweb steel joists and joist girders shall be in accordance with either SJI 100 or SJI](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromSJI_RefStdSJI_100_20)
200, as applicable.

**2207.1.1 Seismic design.**

[Where required, the seismic design of buildings shall be in accordance with the additional provisions of Section 2205.2 or](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2205.2)
[2211.1.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2211.1.1)

**2207.2 Design.**

The registered design professional shall indicate on the construction documents the steel joist and steel joist girder
[designations from the specifications listed in Section 2207.1; and shall indicate the requirements for joist and joist girder](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.1)
[design, layout, end supports, anchorage, bridging design that differs from the SJI specifications listed in Section 2207.1,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.1)
bridging termination connections and bearing connection design to resist uplift and lateral loads. These documents shall
indicate special requirements as follows:


1. Special loads including:

1.1. Concentrated loads.

1.2. Nonuniform loads.

1.3. Net uplift loads.

1.4. Axial loads.

1.5. End moments.

1.6. Connection forces.

2. Special considerations including:


2.1. Profiles for joist and joist girder configurations that differ from those defined by the SJI specifications listed in

[Section 2207.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.1)

2.2. Oversized or other nonstandard web openings.

2.3. Extended ends.

3. Live and total load deflection criteria for joists and joist girder configurations that differ from those defined by the

[SJI specifications listed in Section 2207.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.1)

**2207.3 Calculations.**

The steel joist and joist girder manufacturer shall design the steel joists and steel joist girders in accordance with the SJI
[specifications listed in Section 2207.1 to support the load requirements of Section 2207.2. The registered design](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.1)
_professional shall be permitted to require submission of the steel joist and joist girder calculations as prepared by a_
_registered design professional responsible for the product design. Where requested by the registered design professional,_
the steel joist manufacturer shall submit design calculations with a cover letter bearing the seal and signature of the joist
manufacturer’s registered design professional. In addition to the design calculations submitted under seal and signature,
the following shall be included:


1. [Bridging design that differs from the SJI specifications listed in Section 2207.1, such as cantilevered conditions](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.1)

and net uplift.

2. Connection design for:


2.1. [Connections that differ from the SJI specifications listed in Section 2207.1, such as flush-framed or framed](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.1)

connections.

2.2. Field splices.

2.3. Joist headers.

**2207.4 Steel joist drawings.**

_Steel joist placement plans shall be provided to show the steel joist products as specified on the approved construction_
_documents and are to be utilized for field installation in accordance with specific project requirements as stated in_
[Section 2207.2. Steel joist placement plans shall include, at a minimum, the following:](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.2)


1. [Listing of applicable loads as stated in Section 2207.2 and used in the design of the steel joists and joist girders as](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.2)


specified in the approved construction documents.


2. Profiles for joist and joist girder configurations that differ from those defined by the SJI specifications listed in


[Section 2207.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2207.1)
