# CHAPTER 1 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION 101
 GENERAL


**101.1 Short title.**


The Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, Part I, Construction, may be cited as the Virginia Construction Code or as
the VCC. The term “USBC” shall mean the VCC unless the context in which the term is used clearly indicates it to be an
abbreviation for the entire Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code or for a different part of the Virginia Uniform
_Statewide Building Code._

**Note: This code is also known as the 2021 edition of the USBC due to the use of the 2021 editions of the model**


codes.

**101.2** **Incorporation by reference.**


[Chapters 2–35 of the 2021 International Building Code, published by the International Code Council, Inc. (ICC), are®](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch02)
adopted and incorporated by reference to be an enforceable part of the USBC. The term “IBC ” means the 2021®
_[International Building Code, published by the International Code Council, Inc. Any codes and standards referenced in the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IBC%E2%80%9421)_
IBC are also considered to be part of the incorporation by reference, except that such codes and standards are used only
to the prescribed extent of each such reference. In addition, any provisions of the appendices of the IBC specifically
identified to be part of the USBC are also considered to be part of the incorporation by reference.


**Notes:**

1. The IBC references other International Codes and standards including the following major codes:

[2020 NFPA 70](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd70_20)

[2021 International Energy Conservation Code® (IECC®)](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIECC_21)


[2021 International Fuel Gas Code® (IFGC®)](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIFGC_21)

[2021 International Mechanical Code® (IMC )®](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIMC_21)


[2021 International Plumbing Code® (IPC )®](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIPC_21)


[2021 International Residential Code® (IRC )®](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIRC_21)

2. [The IRC is applicable to the construction of detached one-family and two-family dwellings and townhouses as](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIRC_21)

[set out in Section 310.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch03_Sec310)

**101.3 Numbering system.**

A dual numbering system is used in the USBC to correlate the numbering system of the Virginia Administrative Code with
the numbering system of the IBC. IBC numbering system designations are provided in the catchlines of the Virginia
_[Administrative Code sections. Cross references between sections or chapters of the USBC use only the IBC numbering](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IBC%E2%80%9421)_
system designations. The term “chapter” is used in the context of the numbering system of the IBC and may mean a
[chapter in the USBC, a chapter in the IBC or a chapter in a referenced code or standard, depending on the context of the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IBC%E2%80%9421)
use of the term. The term “chapter” is not used to designate a chapter of the Virginia Administrative Code, unless clearly
indicated.


**101.4 Arrangement of code provisions.**


[The USBC is comprised of the combination of (i) the provisions of Chapter 1, Administration, which are established herein,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)
[(ii) Chapters 2–35 of the IBC, which are incorporated by reference in Section 101.2, and (iii) the changes to the text of the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch02)
incorporated chapters of the IBC that are specifically identified. The terminology “changes to the text of the incorporated
[chapters of the IBC that are specifically identified” shall also be referred to as the “state amendments to the IBC.” Such](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IBC%E2%80%9421)
[state amendments to the IBC are set out using corresponding chapter and section numbers of the IBC numbering system.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IBC%E2%80%9421)
[In addition, since Chapter 1 of the IBC is not incorporated as part of the USBC, any reference to a provision of Chapter 1 of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)
[the IBC in the provisions of Chapters 2–35 of the IBC is generally invalid. However, where the purpose of such a reference](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch02)
[would clearly correspond to a provision of Chapter 1 established herein, then the reference may be construed to be a](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)
[valid reference to such corresponding Chapter 1 provision.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)


**101.5 Use of terminology and notes.**

The provisions of this code shall be used as follows:


1. [The term “this code,” or “the code,” where used in the provisions of Chapter 1, in Chapters 2–35 of the IBC or in](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)


the state amendments to the IBC means the USBC, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.


2. The term “this code,” or “the code,” where used in a code or standard referenced in the IBC means that code or


standard, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.


3. [The use of notes in Chapter 1 is to provide information only and shall not be construed as changing the meaning](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)


of any code provision.

same subject matter and impose differing requirements.

IBC that address the same subject matter and impose differing requirements.

subject matter and impose differing requirements.

4. The state amendments to the IBC supersede any provisions of the codes and standards referenced in the IBC that


address the same subject matter and impose differing requirements.


5. [The provisions of Chapters 2–35 of the IBC supersede any provisions of the codes and standards referenced in the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch02)


IBC that address the same subject matter and impose differing requirements.


6. [The provisions of the National Electrical Code (NEC), Virginia Mechanical Code (VMC), Virginia Plumbing Code](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd70_20)

[(VPC) and Virginia Fuel Gas Code (VFGC) supersede any provisions of the Virginia Energy Conservation Code (VECC)](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VAPC%E2%80%9421)
that address the same subject matter and impose differing requirements.

7. [The provisions of Chapters 2–10 and 12–44 of the Virginia Residential Code (VRC) supersede any provisions of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VARC2021P1_Ch02)

**101.7 Administrative provisions.**

[The provisions of Chapter 1 establish administrative requirements, which include provisions relating to the scope of the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)
[code, enforcement, fees, permits, inspections and disputes. Any provisions of Chapters 2–35 of the IBC or any provisions](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch02)
of the codes and standards referenced in the IBC that address the same subject matter and impose differing
[requirements are deleted and replaced by the provisions of Chapter 1. Further, any administrative requirements](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)
[contained in the state amendments to the IBC shall be given the same precedence as the provisions of Chapter 1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)
[Notwithstanding the above, where administrative requirements of Chapters 2–35 of the IBC or of the codes and standards](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch02)
[referenced in the IBC are specifically identified as valid administrative requirements in Chapter 1 of this code or in the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01)
state amendments to the IBC, then such requirements are not deleted and replaced.

**Note: The purpose of this provision is to eliminate overlap, conflicts and duplication by providing a single standard**

for administrative, procedural and enforcement requirements of this code.

**101.8 Definitions.**

[The definitions of terms used in this code are contained in Chapter 2 along with specific provisions addressing the use of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch02)
definitions. Terms may be defined in other chapters or provisions of the code and such definitions are also valid.

**[Note: The order of precedence outlined in Section 101.6 may be determinative in establishing how to apply the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01_Sec101.6)**

definitions in the IBC and in the referenced codes and standards.
