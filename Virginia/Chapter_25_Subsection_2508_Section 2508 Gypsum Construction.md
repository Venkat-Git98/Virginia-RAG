 SECTION 2508
 GYPSUM CONSTRUCTION

**2508.1 General.**


_[Gypsum board, gypsum panel products and gypsum plaster construction shall be of the materials listed in Tables 2506.2](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch25_Sec2506.2_Tbl2506.2)_
[and 2507.2. These materials shall be assembled and installed in compliance with the appropriate standards listed in](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch25_Sec2507.2_Tbl2507.2)
[Tables 2508.1 and 2511.1.1 and Chapter 35.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch25_Sec2508.1_Tbl2508.1)


**TABLE 2508.1**

**INSTALLATION OF GYPSUM CONSTRUCTION**

|MATERIAL|STANDARD|
|---|---|
|Gypsum board and gypsum panel products|GA-216; ASTM C840|
|Gypsum sheathing and gypsum panel products|ASTM C1280|
|Gypsum veneer base|ASTM C844|
|Interior lathing and furring|ASTM C841|
|Steel framing for gypsum board and gypsum panel products|ASTM C754; C1007|


**2508.2 Limitations.**


_Gypsum wallboard or gypsum plaster shall not be used in any exterior surface where such gypsum construction will be_
exposed directly to the weather. Gypsum wallboard shall not be used where there will be direct exposure to water or
continuous high humidity conditions. Gypsum sheathing shall be installed on exterior surfaces in accordance with ASTM
C1280.

**2508.2.1 Weather protection.**

_Gypsum wallboard, gypsum lath or gypsum plaster shall not be installed until weather protection for the installation is_
provided.

**2508.3 Single-ply application.**

Edges and ends of gypsum board and gypsum panel products shall occur on the framing members, except those edges
and ends that are perpendicular to the framing members. Edges and ends of gypsum board and gypsum panel products
shall be in moderate contact except in concealed spaces where fire-resistance-rated construction, shear resistance or
_diaphragm action is not required._


**2508.3.1 Floating angles.**


Fasteners at the top and bottom plates of vertical assemblies, or the edges and ends of horizontal assemblies
perpendicular to supports, and at the wall line are permitted to be omitted except on shear resisting elements or fireresistance-rated assemblies. Fasteners shall be applied in such a manner as not to fracture the face paper with the
fastener head.


**2508.4 Adhesives.**


_Gypsum board and gypsum panel products secured to framing with adhesives in ceiling assemblies shall be attached_
using an approved fastening schedule. Expandable foam adhesives for fastening gypsum wallboard shall conform to
[ASTM D6464. Other adhesives for the installation of gypsum wallboard shall conform to ASTM C557.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdD6464_2003A2017)

**2508.5 Joint treatment.**

_Gypsum board and gypsum panel product fire-resistance-rated assemblies shall have joints and fasteners treated._

**Exception: Joint and fastener treatment need not be provided where any of the following conditions occur:**

1. Where the gypsum board or the gypsum panel product is to receive a decorative finish such as wood paneling,

battens, acoustical finishes or any similar application that would be equivalent to joint treatment.

2. On single-layer systems where joints occur over wood framing members.

3. Square edge or tongue-and-groove edge gypsum board (V-edge), gypsum panel products, gypsum backing

board or gypsum sheathing.

4. On multilayer systems where the joints of adjacent layers are offset.

5. Assemblies tested without joint treatment.

**2508.6 Horizontal gypsum board or gypsum panel product diaphragm ceilings.**

 a. Values are not cumulative with other horizontal diaphragm values and are for
 short-term wind or seismic loading. Values shall be reduced 25 percent for normal loading.

 b. Values shall be reduced 50 percent in Seismic Design Categories D, E and F.

**2508.6.2 Installation.**

_Gypsum board or gypsum panel products used in a horizontal diaphragm ceiling shall be installed perpendicular to ceiling_
framing members. End joints of adjacent courses of gypsum board shall not occur on the same joist.

**2508.6.3 Blocking of perimeter edges.**

Perimeter edges shall be blocked using a wood member not less than 2-inch by 6-inch (51 mm by 152 mm) nominal
dimension. Blocking material shall be installed flat over the top plate of the wall to provide a nailing surface not less than
2 inches (51 mm) in width for the attachment of the gypsum board or gypsum panel product.
