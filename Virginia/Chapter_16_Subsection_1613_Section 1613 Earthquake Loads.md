 SECTION 1613
 EARTHQUAKE LOADS


**1613.1 Scope.**


Every structure, and portion thereof, including nonstructural components that are permanently attached to structures
and their supports and attachments, shall be designed and constructed to resist the effects of earthquake motions in
[accordance with Chapters 11, 12, 13, 15, 17 and 18 of ASCE 7, as applicable. The seismic design category for a structure](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
[is permitted to be determined in accordance with Section 1613 or ASCE 7.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1613)

**Exceptions:**

1. Detached one- and two-family dwellings, assigned to Seismic Design Category A, B or C, or located where the


mapped short-period spectral response acceleration, S, is less than 0.4 g.S


2. [The seismic force-resisting system of wood-frame buildings that conform to the provisions of Section 2308 are](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2308)


not required to be analyzed as specified in this section.

3. Agricultural storage structures intended only for incidental human occupancy.


4. Structures that require special consideration of their response characteristics and environment that are not

[addressed by this code or ASCE 7 and for which other regulations provide seismic criteria, such as vehicular](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
bridges, electrical transmission towers, hydraulic structures, buried utility lines and their appurtenances and
nuclear reactors.


5. [References within ASCE 7 to Chapter 14 shall not apply, except as specifically required herein.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

**1613.2 Seismic ground motion values.**

Seismic ground motion values shall be determined in accordance with this section.

**1613.2.1 Mapped acceleration parameters.**


The parameters S and S _S shall be determined from the 0.2 and 1-second spectral response accelerations shown on1_
[Figures 1613.2.1(1) through 1613.2.1(10). Where S is less than or equal to 0.04 and 1](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1613.2.1_Fig1613.2.1_1) _S is less than or equal to 0.15, theS_
structure is permitted to be assigned Seismic Design Category A.
