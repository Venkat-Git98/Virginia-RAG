2. The water-resistive barrier shall be 60-minute Grade D paper or have a water resistance equal to or greater than

[one layer of water-resistive barrier complying with ASTM E2556, Type II. The water-resistive barrier shall be](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE2556_E2556M_2010_2016)
separated from the stucco by a layer of foam plastic insulating sheathing or other nonwater absorbing layer, or a

(4.8 mm) in depth shall be applied to the exterior side of the water-resistive barrier.
