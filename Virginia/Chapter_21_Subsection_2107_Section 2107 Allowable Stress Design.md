# CHAPTER 21 MASONRY

 SECTION 2107
 ALLOWABLE STRESS DESIGN


**2107.1 General.**

[The design of masonry structures using allowable stress design shall comply with Section 2106 and the requirements of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch21_Sec2106)
[Chapters 1 through 8 of TMS 402 except as modified by Sections 2107.2 through 2107.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromTMS_RefStd402_2016)

**2107.2 TMS 402, Section 6.1.6.1.1, lap splices.**

[As an alternative to Section 6.1.6.1.1, it shall be permitted to design lap splices in accordance with Section 2107.2.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch21_Sec2107.2.1)

**2107.2.1 Lap splices.**


The minimum length of lap splices for reinforcing bars in tension or compression, l, shall be:d


**(Equation 21-1)**


but not less than 12 inches (305 mm). The length of the lapped splice shall be not less than 40 bar diameters.

where:

_d = Diameter of reinforcement, inches (mm)b_


_f = Computed stress in reinforcement due to design loads, psi (MPa).s_


In regions of moment where the design tensile stresses in the reinforcement are greater than 80 percent of the

allowable steel tension stress, Fs, the lap length of splices shall be increased not less than 50 percent of the minimum
required length, but need not be greater than 72 d . Other equivalent means of stress transfer to accomplish the same 50b
percent increase shall be permitted. Where epoxy coated bars are used, lap length shall be increased by 50 percent.


**2107.3 TMS 402, Section 6.1.6.1, splices of reinforcement.**

Modify Section 6.1.6.1 as follows:


6.1.6.1 – Splices of reinforcement. Lap splices, welded splices or mechanical splices are permitted in accordance

[with the provisions of this section. Welding shall conform to AWS D1.4. Welded splices shall be of ASTM A706 steel](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAWS_RefStdD1_4_D1_4M_2018)
reinforcement. Reinforcement larger than No. 9 (M #29) shall be spliced using mechanical connections in
accordance with Section 6.1.6.1.3.
