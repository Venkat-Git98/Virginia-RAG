For chimneys up to 40 inches (1016 mm) wide, four No. 4 continuous vertical bars anchored in the foundation shall be
placed in the concrete between wythes of solid masonry or within the cells of hollow unit masonry and grouted in
[accordance with Section 2103.3. Grout shall be prevented from bonding with the flue liner so that the flue liner is free to](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch21_Sec2103.3)

**2113.3.2 Horizontal reinforcement.**


Vertical reinforcement shall be placed enclosed within / -inch (6.4 mm) ties, or other reinforcing of equivalent net cross-1 4
sectional area, spaced not to exceed 18 inches (457 mm) on center in concrete, or placed in the bed joints of unit
masonry, at not less than every 18 inches (457 mm) of vertical height. Two such ties shall be provided at each bend in
the vertical bars.


**2113.4 Seismic anchorage.**


Masonry chimneys and foundations shall be anchored at each floor, ceiling or roof line more than 6 feet (1829 mm)
above grade with two /3 16-inch by 1-inch (4.8 mm by 25 mm) straps embedded not less than 12 inches (305 mm) into the

chimney. Straps shall be hooked around the outer bars and extend 6 inches (152 mm) beyond the bend. Each strap shall

Masonry chimneys shall not be corbeled more than half of the chimney’s wall thickness from a wall or foundation, nor
shall a chimney be corbeled from a wall or foundation that is less than 12 inches (305 mm) in thickness unless it projects
equally on each side of the wall, except that on the second story of a two-story dwelling, corbeling of chimneys on the
exterior of the enclosing walls is permitted to equal the wall thickness. The projection of a single course shall not exceed
one-half the unit height or one-third of the unit bed depth, whichever is less.


**2113.6 Changes in dimension.**


The chimney wall or chimney flue lining shall not change in size or shape within 6 inches (152 mm) above or below where
the chimney passes through floor components, ceiling components or roof components.


**2113.7 Offsets.**


Where a masonry chimney is constructed with a fireclay flue liner surrounded by one wythe of masonry, the maximum
offset shall be such that the centerline of the flue above the offset does not extend beyond the center of the chimney wall
below the offset. Where the chimney offset is supported by masonry below the offset in an approved manner, the
maximum offset limitations shall not apply. Each individual corbeled masonry course of the offset shall not exceed the
[projection limitations specified in Section 2113.5.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch21_Sec2113.5)
