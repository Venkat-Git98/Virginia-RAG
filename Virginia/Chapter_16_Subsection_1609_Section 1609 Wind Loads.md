**1609.4 Exposure category.**


For each wind direction considered, an exposure category that adequately reflects the characteristics of ground surface
irregularities shall be determined for the site at which the building or structure is to be constructed. Account shall be
taken of variations in ground surface roughness that arise from natural topography and vegetation as well as from
constructed features.


**1609.4.1 Wind directions and sectors.**


For each selected wind direction at which the wind loads are to be evaluated, the exposure of the building or structure
shall be determined for the two upwind sectors extending 45 degrees (0.79 rad) either side of the selected wind direction.
[The exposures in these two sectors shall be determined in accordance with Sections 1609.4.2 and 1609.4.3 and the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1609.4.2)
exposure resulting in the highest wind loads shall be used to represent winds from that direction.

**1609.4.2 Surface roughness categories.**

A ground surface roughness within each 45-degree (0.79 rad) sector shall be determined for a distance upwind of the site
[as defined in Section 1609.4.3 from the following categories, for the purpose of assigning an exposure category as](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1609.4.3)
[defined in Section 1609.4.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1609.4.3)

**Surface Roughness B. Urban and suburban areas, wooded areas or other terrain with numerous closely spaced**

obstructions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger.

**Surface Roughness C. Open terrain with scattered obstructions having heights generally less than 30 feet (9144**


mm). This category includes flat open country, and grasslands.

**Surface Roughness D. Flat, unobstructed areas and water surfaces. This category includes smooth mud flats, salt**

flats and unbroken ice.

**1609.4.3 Exposure categories.**

An exposure category shall be determined in accordance with the following:

**Exposure B. For buildings with a mean roof height of less than or equal to 30 feet (9144 mm), Exposure B shall**

apply where the ground surface roughness, as defined by Surface Roughness B, prevails in the upwind direction for
a distance of not less than 1,500 feet (457 m). For buildings with a mean roof height greater than 30 feet (9144
mm), Exposure B shall apply where Surface Roughness B prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of not less
than 2,600 feet (792 m) or 20 times the height of the building, whichever is greater.


**Exposure C. Exposure C shall apply for all cases where Exposure B or D does not apply.**

**Exposure D. Exposure D shall apply where the ground surface roughness, as defined by Surface Roughness D,**

prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of not less than 5,000 feet (1524 m) or 20 times the height of the
building, whichever is greater. Exposure D shall apply where the ground surface roughness immediately upwind of
the site is B or C, and the site is within a distance of 600 feet (183 m) or 20 times the building height, whichever is
greater, from an Exposure D condition as defined in the previous sentence.
