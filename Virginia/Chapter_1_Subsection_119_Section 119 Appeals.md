# CHAPTER 1 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION 119
 APPEALS


**119.1 Establishment of appeals board.**


In accordance with § 36-105 of the Code of Virginia, there shall be established within each local building department a
_local board of building code appeals (LBBCA). Whenever a county or a municipality does not have such a LBBCA, the local_
_governing body shall enter into an agreement with the local governing body of another county or municipality or with_
some other agency, or a state agency approved by DHCD for such appeals resulting therefrom. Fees may be levied by
the local governing body in order to defray the cost of such appeals. In addition, as an authorization in this code, separate
_LBBCAs may be established to hear appeals of different enforcement areas such as electrical, plumbing or mechanical_
requirements. Each such LBBCA shall comply with the requirements of this section. The locality is responsible for
maintaining a duly constituted LBBCA prepared to hear appeals within the time limits established in this section. The
_LBBCA shall meet as necessary to assure a duly constituted board, appoint officers as necessary, and receive such_
training on the code as may be appropriate or necessary from staff of the locality.

**119.2 Membership of board.**

The LBBCA shall consist of at least five members appointed by the locality for a specific term of office established by
written policy. Alternate members may be appointed to serve in the absence of any regular members and as such, shall
have the full power and authority of the regular members. Regular and alternate members may be reappointed. Written
records of current membership, including a record of the current chairman and secretary shall be maintained in the office
of the locality. In order to provide continuity, the terms of the members may be of different length so that less than half
will expire in any 1-year period.

**119.3 Officers and qualifications of members.**

The LBBCA shall annually select one of its regular members to serve as chairman. When the chairman is not present at an
appeal hearing, the members present shall select an acting chairman. The locality or the chief executive officer of the
_locality shall appoint a secretary to the LBBCA to maintain a detailed record of all proceedings. Members of the LBBCA_
shall be selected by the locality on the basis of their ability to render fair and competent decisions regarding application
of the USBC and shall to the extent possible, represent different occupational or professional fields relating to the
construction industry. At least one member should be an experienced builder; at least one member should be an _RDP;_
and at least one member should be an experienced property manager. Employees or officials of the _locality shall not_
serve as members of the LBBCA.


**119.4 Conduct of members.**


No member shall hear an appeal in which that member has a conflict of interest in accordance with the State and Local
Government Conflict of Interests Act (§ 2.2-3100 et seq. of the Code of Virginia). Members shall not discuss the substance
of an appeal with any other party or their representatives prior to any hearings.


**119.5 Right of appeal; filing of appeal application.**


Any person aggrieved by the local building department’s application of the USBC or the refusal to grant a modification to
the provisions of the USBC may appeal to the LBBCA. The applicant shall submit a written request for appeal to the LBBCA
within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the decision being appealed. The application shall contain the name and address
of the owner of the building or structure and, in addition, the name and address of the person appealing, when the
applicant is not the owner. A copy of the building official’s decision shall be submitted along with the application for
appeal and maintained as part of the record. The application shall be marked by the LBBCA to indicate the date received.
Failure to submit an application for appeal within the time limit established by this section shall constitute acceptance of
a building official’s decision.

**Note: To the extent that a decision of a building official pertains to amusement devices there may be a right of**

appeal under the VADR.

**119.6 Meetings and postponements.**

The LBBCA shall meet within 30 calendar days after the date of receipt of the application for appeal, except that a period
of up to 45 calendar days shall be permitted where the LBBCA has regularly scheduled monthly meetings. A longer time
period shall be permitted if agreed to by all the parties involved in the appeal. Notice indicating the time and place of the
hearing shall be sent to the parties in writing to the addresses listed on the application if requested or by electronic
means at least 14 calendar days prior to the date of the hearing unless a lesser time period is agreed to by all the parties
involved in the appeal. When a quorum of the LBBCA is not present at a hearing to hear an appeal, any party involved in
the appeal shall have the right to request a postponement of the hearing. The LBBCA shall reschedule the appeal within
30 calendar days of the postponement, except that a longer time period shall be permitted if agreed to by all the parties

and duty to hear all appeals from decisions arising under the application of the USBC and to render its decision on any

official for state-owned buildings or structures shall be made directly to the State Review Board. The application for
appeal shall be made to the State Review Board within 21 calendar days of the receipt of the decision to be appealed.
