# CHAPTER 19 CONCRETE

 SECTION 1901
 GENERAL


**1901.1 Scope.**

The provisions of this chapter shall govern the materials, quality control, design and construction of concrete used in
structures.

**1901.2 Plain and reinforced concrete.**

[Structural concrete shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and ACI 318 as](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromACI_RefStd318_19)
[amended in Section 1905 of this code. Except for the provisions of Sections 1904 and 1907, the design and construction](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch19_Sec1905)
of slabs on grade shall not be governed by this chapter unless they transmit vertical loads or lateral forces from other
parts of the structure to the soil.

**1901.3 Anchoring to concrete.**

[Anchoring to concrete shall be in accordance with ACI 318 as amended in Section 1905, and applies to cast-in (headed](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromACI_RefStd318_19)
bolts, headed studs and hooked J- or L-bolts), post-installed expansion (torque-controlled and displacement-controlled),
undercut, screw, and adhesive anchors.

**1901.4 Composite structural steel and concrete structures.**

Systems of structural steel acting compositely with reinforced concrete shall be designed in accordance with Section
2206 of this code.

**1901.5 Construction documents.**

The construction documents for structural concrete construction shall include:

1. The specified compressive strength of concrete at the stated ages or stages of construction for which each


concrete element is designed.

2. The specified strength or grade of reinforcement.

3. The size and location of structural elements, reinforcement and anchors.

4. Provision for dimensional changes resulting from creep, shrinkage and temperature.

5. The magnitude and location of prestressing forces.

6. Anchorage length of reinforcement and location and length of lap splices.

7. Type and location of mechanical and welded splices of reinforcement.

8. Details and location of contraction or isolation joints specified for plain concrete.

9. Minimum concrete compressive strength at time of posttensioning.

10. Stressing sequence for posttensioning tendons.

11. For structures assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F, a statement if slab on grade is designed as a

structural diaphragm.

**1901.6 Special inspections and tests.**

_Special inspections and tests of concrete elements of buildings and structures and concreting operations shall be as_
[required by Chapter 17.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17)

**1901.7** **Tolerances for structural concrete.**

Where not indicated in construction documents, structural tolerances for concrete structural elements shall be in
accordance with this section.


**1901.7.1** **Cast-in-place concrete tolerances.**

[Structural tolerances for cast-in-place concrete structural elements shall be in accordance with ACI 117.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromACI_RefStd117_10)

**Exceptions:**

1. Group R-3 detached one- or two-family dwellings are not required to comply with this section.

2. Shotcrete is not required to comply with this section.

**1901.7.2** **Precast concrete tolerances.**

[Structural tolerances for precast concrete structural elements shall be in accordance with ACI ITG-7.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromACI_RefStdITG_7_09)

**Exception: Group R-3 detached one- or two-family dwellings are not required to comply with this section.**
