 SECTION 103
 APPLICATION OF CODE


**103.1 General.**


In accordance with § 36-99 of the Code of Virginia, the USBC shall prescribe building regulations to be complied with in
the construction and rehabilitation of buildings and structures, and the equipment therein.


**[103.1.1 Virginia Existing Building Code.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VEBC%E2%80%9415)**


[Part II of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, also known as the “Virginia Existing Building Code,” or the “VEBC”](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VAEBC%E2%80%9421)
is applicable to construction and rehabilitation activities in existing buildings and structures, as those terms are defined in
[the VEBC, except where specifically addressed in the VCC.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VEBC%E2%80%9415)


**103.2 When applicable to construction.**


_Construction for which a permit application is submitted to the local building department on or after the effective date of_
the 2021 edition of the code shall comply with the provisions of this code, except for permit applications submitted
during a 1-year period beginning on the effective date of the 2021 edition of the code. The applicant for a permit during
such 1-year period shall be permitted to choose whether to comply with the provisions of this code or the provisions of
the edition of the code in effect immediately prior to the 2021 edition. This provision shall also apply to subsequent
amendments to this code based on the effective date of such amendments. In addition, when a permit has been properly
issued under a previous edition of this code, this code shall not require changes to the approved construction documents,
design or construction of such a building or structure, provided the permit has not been suspended or revoked.


**103.3 Nonrequired equipment.**


The following criteria for nonrequired equipment is in accordance with § 36-103 of the Code of Virginia. Building owners
may elect to install partial or full fire alarms or other safety equipment that was not required by the edition of the USBC
in effect at the time a building was constructed without meeting current requirements of the code, provided the
installation does not create a hazardous condition. Permits for installation shall be obtained in accordance with this code.
In addition, as a requirement of this code, when such nonrequired equipment is to be installed, the building official shall
notify the appropriate fire official or fire chief.


**103.3.1 Reduction in function or discontinuance of nonrequired fire protection systems.**


When a nonrequired fire protection system is to be reduced in function or discontinued, it shall be done in such a manner
so as not to create a false sense of protection. Generally, in such cases, any features visible from interior areas shall be
removed, such as sprinkler heads, smoke detectors or alarm panels or devices, but any wiring or piping hidden within the
_construction of the building may remain. Approval of the proposed method of reduction or discontinuance shall be_
obtained from the building official.


**103.4 Use of certain provisions of referenced codes.**


[The following provisions of the IBC and of other indicated codes or standards are to be considered valid provisions of this](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IBC%E2%80%9421)

_design professional (RDP)._


5. [Section N1102.1 of the IRC and Sections C402.1.1, C402.1.1.1, and R402.1 of the IECC.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IRC2021P1_Pt04_Ch11_SecN1102.1)

**103.5 Functional design.**

supersede the regulations of other state agencies that require and govern the functional design and operation of building
related activities not covered by the USBC, including (i) public water supply systems, (ii) waste water treatment and
disposal systems, and (iii) solid waste facilities. Nor shall state agencies be prohibited from requiring, pursuant to other
state law, that buildings and equipment be maintained in accordance with provisions of this code. In addition, as
established by this code, the building official may refuse to issue a permit until the applicant has supplied certificates of
functional design approval from the appropriate state agency or agencies. For purposes of coordination, the locality may

of occupancy. Such reports shall be based upon review of the plans or inspection of the project as determined by the
_locality. All enforcement of these conditions shall not be the responsibility of the building official, but rather the agency_
imposing the condition.

available from DHCD.

**103.6 Amusement devices and inspections.**

In accordance with § 36-98.3 of the Code of Virginia, to the extent they are not superseded by the provisions of § 36-98.3
of the Code of Virginia and the Virginia Amusement Device Regulations (VADR), the provisions of the USBC shall apply to
amusement devices. In addition, as a requirement of this code, inspections for compliance with the VADR shall be
conducted either by local building department personnel or private inspectors, provided such persons are certified as
amusement device inspectors under the Virginia Certification Standards (VCS).


**103.7 State buildings and structures.**


This section establishes the application of the USBC to state-owned buildings and structures in accordance with § 36-98.1
of the Code of Virginia. The USBC shall be applicable to all state-owned buildings and structures, with the exception that
§§ 2.2-1159 through 2.2-1161 of the Code of Virginia shall provide the standards for ready access to and use of stateowned buildings by the physically handicapped.

Any state-owned building or structure or building built on state-owned property for which preliminary plans were

prepared or on which construction commenced after the initial effective date of the USBC shall remain subject to the
provisions of the USBC that were in effect at the time such plans were completed or such construction commenced.
Subsequent reconstruction, renovation or demolition of such building or structure shall be subject to the pertinent
provisions of this code.

Acting through the Division of Engineering and Buildings, the Virginia Department of General Services shall function


as the building official for state-owned buildings. The department shall review and approve plans and specifications, grant
modifications, and establish such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this section. It shall provide for
the inspection of state-owned buildings and enforcement of the USBC and standards for access by the physically
handicapped by delegating inspection and USBC enforcement duties to the State Fire Marshal’s Office, to other
appropriate state agencies having needed expertise, and to local building departments, all of which shall provide such
assistance within a reasonable time and in the manner requested. State agencies and institutions occupying buildings
shall pay to the local building department the same fees as would be paid by a private citizen for the services rendered
when such services are requested by the department. The department may alter or overrule any decision of the local
_building department after having first considered the local building department’s report or other rationale given for its_
decision. When altering or overruling any decision of a local building department, the department shall provide the local
_building department with a written summary of its reasons for doing so._

Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, roadway tunnels and bridges owned by the Virginia


Department of Transportation shall be exempt from this code. The Virginia Department of General Services shall not have
jurisdiction over such roadway tunnels, bridges and other limited access highways provided, however, that the
Department of General Services shall have jurisdiction over any occupied buildings within any Department of
Transportation rights-of-way that are subject to this code.

Except as provided in subsection E of § 23.1-1016 of the Code of Virginia, and notwithstanding any provision of this


code to the contrary, at the request of a public institution of higher education, the Virginia Department of General
Services, as further set forth in this provision, shall authorize that institution of higher education to contract with a
building official of the locality in which the construction is taking place to perform any inspection and certifications
required for the purpose of complying with this code. The department shall publish administrative procedures that shall
be followed in contracting with a building official of the locality. The authority granted to a public institution of higher
education under this provision to contract with a building official of the locality shall be subject to the institution meeting
the conditions prescribed in subsection A of § 23.1-1002 of the Code of Virginia.

**Note: In accordance with § 36-98.1 of the Code of Virginia, roadway tunnels and bridges shall be designed,**

constructed and operated to comply with fire safety standards based on nationally recognized model codes and
standards to be developed by the Virginia Department of Transportation in consultation with the State Fire Marshal.
Emergency response planning and activities related to the standards shall be developed by the Department of
Transportation and coordinated with the appropriate local officials and emergency service providers. On an annual
basis, the Department of Transportation shall provide a report on the maintenance and operability of installed fire
protection and detection systems in roadway tunnels and bridges to the State Fire Marshal.
