# CHAPTER 7 FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES

 SECTION 715
 JOINTS AND VOIDS


Relocated

**715.1** **General.**


The provisions of this section shall govern the materials and methods of construction used to protect joints and voids in
or between horizontal and vertical assemblies.


**715.2 Installation.**


Systems or materials protecting joints and voids shall be securely installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
installation instructions in or on the joint or void for its entire length so as not to dislodge, loosen or otherwise impair its
ability to accommodate expected building movements and to resist the passage of fire and hot gases. Fire-resistant joint
_systems or systems used to protect voids at exterior curtain walls and fire-resistance-rated floor intersections shall also_
be installed in accordance with the listing criteria.


Relocated

**715.3** **Fire-resistance-rated assembly intersections.**


_Joints installed in or between fire-resistance-rated walls, floor or floor/ceiling assemblies and roofs or roof/ceiling_
assemblies shall be protected by an approved fire-resistant joint system designed to resist the passage of fire for a time
period not less than the required fire-resistance rating of the wall, floor or roof in or between which the system is
installed.


**Exception: Fire-resistant joint systems shall not be required for joints in the following locations:**

1. Floors within a single dwelling unit.

2. [Floors where the joint is protected by a shaft enclosure in accordance with Section 713.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec713)


3. Floors within atriums where the space adjacent to the atrium is included in the volume of the atrium for smoke

control purposes.

4. Floors within malls.

5. [Floors and ramps within parking garages or structures constructed in accordance with Sections 406.5 and](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch04_Sec406.5)

[406.6.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch04_Sec406.6)

6. _Mezzanine floors._

7. Walls that are permitted to have unprotected openings.

8. Roofs where openings are permitted.

9. Control joints not exceeding a maximum width of 0.625 inch (15.9 mm) and tested in accordance with ASTM


[E119 or UL 263.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromUL_RefStd263_11)

10. The intersection of exterior curtain wall assemblies and the roof slab or roof deck.

**715.3.1 Fire test criteria.**


_[Fire-resistant joint systems shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of either ASTM E1966 or UL 2079.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE1966_15)_
Nonsymmetrical wall joint systems shall be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the assigned fire_resistance rating shall be the shortest duration obtained from the two tests. Where evidence is furnished to show that the_
wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to the furnace, subject to acceptance of the building official, the
wall need not be subjected to tests from the opposite side.

**Exception: For exterior walls with a horizontal fire separation distance greater than 10 feet (3048 mm), the joint**
system shall be required to be tested for interior fire exposure only.


**715.4 Exterior curtain wall/fire-resistance-rated floor intersections.**


Voids created at the intersection of exterior curtain wall assemblies and fire-resistance-rated floor or floor/ceiling
assemblies shall be protected with an approved perimeter fire containment system to prevent the interior spread of fire.
Such systems shall provide an F rating for a time period not less than the fire-resistance rating of the floor or floor/ceiling
assembly.


**715.4.1** **Fire test criteria.**

_[Perimeter fire containment systems shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of ASTM E2307.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE2307_15BE1)_

the interior spread of fire. Such material shall be securely installed and capable of preventing the passage of flame
[and hot gases sufficient to ignite cotton waste where subjected to ASTM E119 time-temperature fire conditions under](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE119_2018B)
a minimum positive pressure differential of 0.01 inch (0.254 mm) of water column (2.5 Pa) for the time period not less
than the fire-resistance rating of the floor assembly.

**715.5 Exterior curtain wall/nonfire-resistance-rated floor assembly intersections.**

Voids created at the intersection of exterior curtain wall assemblies and nonfire-resistance-rated floor or floor/ceiling
assemblies shall be filled with an approved material or system to retard the interior spread of fire and hot gases between
_stories._


**715.6 Exterior curtain wall/vertical fire barrier intersections.**


Voids created at the intersection of nonfire-resistance-rated exterior curtain wall assemblies and vertical _fire barriers_
shall be filled with an approved material or system to retard the interior spread of fire and hot gases.

**715.7 Curtain wall spandrels.**

[Height and fire-resistance requirements for curtain wall spandrels shall comply with Section 705.8.5. Where Section](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec705.8.5)
[705.8.5 does not require fire-resistance-rated curtain wall spandrels, the requirements of Sections 715.4 and 715.5 shall](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec715.4)
still apply to the intersection between the curtain wall spandrels and the floor.

**715.8** **Joints and voids in smoke barriers.**

_Fire-resistant joint systems protecting_ _joints in smoke barriers, and perimeter fire containment systems protecting_
voids at the intersection of a horizontal smoke barrier and an exterior curtain wall, shall be tested in accordance with the
[requirements of UL 2079 for air leakage. The L rating of the joint system shall not exceed 5 cubic feet per minute per](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromUL_RefStd2079_2015)
linear foot (0.00775 m /s m) of joint at 0.30 inch (74.7 Pa) of water for both the ambient temperature and elevated3
temperature tests.
