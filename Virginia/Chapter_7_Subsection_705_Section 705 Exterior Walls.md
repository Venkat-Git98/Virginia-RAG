**705.3 Buildings on the same lot.**

For the purposes of determining the required wall and opening protection, projections and roof-covering requirements,
buildings on the same lot shall be assumed to have an imaginary line between them.

[as portions of one building if the aggregate area of such buildings is within the limits specified in Chapter 5 for a](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch05)
single building. Where the buildings contain different occupancy groups or are of different types of construction,
the area shall be that allowed for the most restrictive occupancy or construction.

2. Where an S-2 parking garage of Construction Type I or IIA is erected on the same lot as a Group R-2 building,

and there is no fire separation distance between these buildings, then the adjoining exterior walls between the
[buildings are permitted to have occupant use openings in accordance with Section 706.8. However, opening](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec706.8)
protectives in such openings shall only be required in the exterior wall of the S-2 parking garage, not in the
_exterior wall openings in the R-2 building, and these opening protectives in the exterior wall of the S-2 parking_
garage shall be not less than 1 / -hour 1 2 _fire protection rating._


**705.4 Materials.**

_Exterior walls shall be of materials permitted by the building’s type of construction._

705.5, based on the _fire separation distance. The required fire-resistance rating of exterior walls with a fire separation_
_distance of greater than 10 feet (3048 mm) shall be rated for exposure to fire from the inside. The required fire-resistance_
_rating of exterior walls with a fire separation distance of less than or equal to 10 feet (3048 mm) shall be rated for_
exposure to fire from both sides.

4.3. Openings in the roof shall not be located within 5 feet (1524 mm) of the 1-hour fire-resistance-rated

_exterior wall for Groups R and U and 10 feet (3048 mm) for other occupancies, measured from the interior_
