1. [A shaft enclosure in accordance with Section 713.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec713)

2. A _listed ceiling radiation damper installed at the ceiling line where a duct penetrates the ceiling of a fire-_


resistance-rated floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assembly.

**Exceptions:**

1. [A fire-resistance-rated assembly tested in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263 showing that ceiling](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE119_2018B)

_radiation dampers are not required in order to maintain the fire-resistance rating of the assembly._

2. [Where exhaust duct or outdoor air duct penetrations protected in accordance with Section 714.5.2 are](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec714.5.2)


located within the cavity of a wall and do not pass through another dwelling unit or tenant space.


3. Where duct and air transfer openings are protected with a duct outlet penetration system tested as part


[of a fire-resistance-rated assembly in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE119_2018B)

**717.6.2.1 Ceiling radiation dampers testing and installation.**


_[Ceiling radiation dampers shall be tested in accordance with Section 717.3.1. Ceiling radiation dampers shall be installed](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec717.3.1)_
in accordance with the details specified in the fire-resistance-rated assembly and the manufacturer’s instructions and the
listing.

**717.6.2.1.1** **Dynamic systems.**

Only ceiling radiation dampers labeled for use in dynamic systems shall be installed in heating, ventilation and airconditioning systems designed to operate with fans on during a fire.

**717.6.2.1.2** **Static systems.**

Static ceiling radiation dampers shall be provided with systems that are not designed to operate during a fire.

**Exceptions:**

1. Where a static ceiling radiation damper is installed at the opening of a duct, a smoke detector shall be

installed inside the duct or outside the duct with sampling tubes protruding into the duct. The detector or tubes in
the duct shall be within 5 feet (1524 mm) of the damper. Air outlets and inlets shall not be located between the
detector or tubes and the damper. The detector shall be listed for the air velocity, temperature and humidity
anticipated at the point where it is installed. Other than in mechanical smoke control systems, dampers shall be
closed upon fan shutdown where local smoke detectors require a minimum velocity to operate.

2 . Where a static ceiling radiation damper is installed in a ceiling, the ceiling radiation damper shall be

permitted to be controlled by a smoke detection system installed in the same room or area as the ceiling
radiation damper.


3. A static ceiling radiation damper shall be permitted to be installed in a room where an occupant sensor is

provided within the room that will shut down the system.

**717.6.2.2** **Equipment shutdown.**

Where ceiling radiation dampers are listed as static dampers, the HVAC equipment shall be effectively shut down to stop
the airflow prior to the damper closing using one of the following methods:

1. A duct detector installed in the return duct.

2. An area smoke detector interlocked with the HVAC equipment.

3. A listed heat sensor installed in the return duct.

**717.6.3 Nonfire-resistance-rated floor assemblies.**

[Duct systems constructed of approved materials in accordance with the International Mechanical Code that penetrate](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IMC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIMC_21)
nonfire-resistance-rated floor assemblies shall be protected by any of the following methods:


1. [A shaft enclosure in accordance with Section 713.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec713)


2. The duct connects not more than two stories, and the annular space around the penetrating duct is protected with

an approved noncombustible material that resists the free passage of flame and the products of combustion.

3. In floor assemblies composed of noncombustible materials, a shaft shall not be required where the duct connects

not more than three stories, the annular space around the penetrating duct is protected with an approved
noncombustible material that resists the free passage of flame and the products of combustion and a fire damper is
installed at each floor line.

**Exception: Fire dampers are not required in ducts within individual residential dwelling units.**

**717.7 Flexible ducts and air connectors.**

Flexible ducts and air connectors shall not pass through any fire-resistance-rated assembly. Flexible air connectors shall
not pass through any wall, floor or ceiling.
