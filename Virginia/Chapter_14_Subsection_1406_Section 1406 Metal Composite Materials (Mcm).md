penetrate through the entire exterior wall assembly, shall not be required to comply with this section.

**1406.9 Surface-burning characteristics.**

Unless otherwise specified, MCM shall have a flame spread index of 75 or less and a smoke-developed index of 450 or
[less when tested in the maximum thickness intended for use in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE84_2018B)

**1406.10 Types I, II, III and IV construction.**

Where installed on buildings of Types I, II, III and IV construction, metal composite material (MCM) shall comply with
[Sections 1406.10.1 and 1406.10.2 for installations up to 40 feet (12 192 mm) above grade plane. Where installed on](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1406.10.1)
[buildings of Types I, II, III and IV construction, MCMs and MCM systems shall comply with Sections 1406.10.1 through](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1406.10.1)
[1406.10.3, for installations greater than 40 feet (12 192 mm) above grade plane.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1406.10.3)

**1406.10.1 Surface-burning characteristics.**

MCM shall have a flame spread index of not more than 25 and a smoke-developed index of not more than 450 when
[tested in the maximum thickness intended for use in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE84_2018B)

**1406.10.2 Thermal barriers.**

MCM shall be separated from the interior of a building by an approved thermal barrier consisting of / -inch (12.7 mm)1 2
_gypsum wallboard or material that is tested in accordance with and meets the acceptance criteria of both the_
[Temperature Transmission Fire Test and the Integrity Fire Test of NFPA 275.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd275_17)


**Exceptions:**


1. [The MCM system is specifically approved based on tests conducted in accordance with NFPA 286 and with the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd286_19)

[acceptance criteria of Section 803.1.1.1, UL 1040 or UL 1715. Such testing shall be performed with the MCM in](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch08_Sec803.1.1.1)
the maximum thickness intended for use. The MCM system shall include seams, joints and other typical details
