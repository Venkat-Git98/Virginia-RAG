**[1301.1 Scope. The provisions of Chapter 13 shall govern the materials, design, construction, and installation of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IPC2021P1_Ch13)**

nonpotable water systems subject to this code. In addition to the applicable provision of this section, reclaimed
[water shall comply with the requirements of Section 1304.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IPC2021P1_Ch13_Sec1304)

**1301.1.1 Design of nonpotable water systems. All portions of nonpotable water systems subject to this**

code shall be constructed using the same standards and requirements for the potable water systems or
drainage systems as provided for in this code unless otherwise specified in this chapter.


**1301.2 Makeup water. Makeup water shall be provided for all nonpotable water supply systems. The makeup**

water system shall be designed and installed to provide supply of water in the amounts and at the pressures
specified in this code. The makeup water supply shall be potable and be protected against backflow in
[accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 608.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IPC2021P1_Ch06_Sec608)


**1301.2.1 Makeup water sources. Potable water shall be provided as makeup water for reclaimed water**

systems. Nonpotable water shall be permitted to serve as makeup water for graywater and rainwater
systems.

**1301.2.2 Makeup water supply valve. A full-open valve shall be provided on the makeup water supply**

line.

**1301.2.3 Control valve alarm. Makeup water systems shall be fitted with a warning mechanism that alerts**

the user to a failure of the inletcontrol valve to close correctly. The alarm shall activate before the water
within the storage tank begins to discharge into the overflow system.


**1301.3 Sizing. Nonpotable water distribution systems shall be designed and sized for peak demand in**

accordance with approved engineering practice methods that comply with the applicable provisions of Chapter
6.

**1301.4 Signage required. All nonpotable water outlets, other than water closets and urinals, such as hose**

connections, open-ended pipes, and faucets, shall be identified at the point of use for each outlet with signage
that reads as follows: “Nonpotable water is utilized for (insert application name). Caution: nonpotable water. DO
NOT DRINK.” The words shall be legibly and indelibly printed on a tag or sign constructed of corrosion-resistant
waterproof material or shall be indelibly printed on the fixture. The letters of the words shall be not less than 0.5
inches (12.7 mm) in height and in colors in contrast to the background on which they are applied. The pictograph
shown in Figure 1301.4 shall appear on the signage required by this section.
