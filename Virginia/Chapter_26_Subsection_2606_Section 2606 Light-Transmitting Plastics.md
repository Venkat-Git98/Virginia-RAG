[a nominal thickness of 0.060 inch (1.5 mm), or in the thickness intended for use, in accordance with ASTM D635.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdD635_14)

**[BS] 2606.5 Structural requirements.**


Light-transmitting plastic materials in their assembly shall be of adequate strength and durability to withstand the loads
[indicated in Chapter 16. Technical data shall be submitted to establish stresses, maximum unsupported spans and such](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16)
other information for the various thicknesses and forms used as deemed necessary by the building official.

**[BS] 2606.6 Fastening.**

[Fastening shall be adequate to withstand the loads in Chapter 16. Proper allowance shall be made for expansion and](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16)
contraction of light-transmitting plastic materials in accordance with accepted data on the coefficient of expansion of the
material and other material in conjunction with which it is employed.

**2606.7 Light-diffusing systems.**

[Unless the building is equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec903.3.1.1)
_light-diffusing systems shall not be installed in the following occupancies and locations:_


1. Group A with an occupant load of 1,000 or more.

2. Theaters with a stage and proscenium opening and an occupant load of 700 or more.

3. Group I-2.

4. Group I-3.

5. _Interior exit stairways and ramps and exit passageways._

**2606.7.1 Support.**


Light-transmitting plastic diffusers shall be supported directly or indirectly from ceiling or roof construction by use of
noncombustible hangers. Hangers shall be not less than No. 12 steel-wire gage (0.106 inch) galvanized wire or
equivalent.


**2606.7.2 Installation.**


[Light-transmitting plastic diffusers shall comply with Chapter 8 unless the light-transmitting plastic diffusers will fall from](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch08)
the mountings before igniting, at an ambient temperature of not less than 200°F (111°C) below the ignition temperature
of the panels. The panels shall remain in place at an ambient room temperature of 175°F (79°C) for a period of not less
than 15 minutes.


**2606.7.3 Size limitations.**

Individual panels or units shall not exceed 10 feet (3048 mm) in length nor 30 square feet (2.79 m) in area.2
