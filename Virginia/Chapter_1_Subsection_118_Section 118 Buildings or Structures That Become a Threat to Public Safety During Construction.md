If the building official determines there is actual and immediate danger to the occupants or public, or when life is
endangered by the occupancy of an unsafe building or structure, the building official shall be authorized to order the
occupants to immediately vacate the unsafe building or structure. When an unsafe building or structure is ordered to be
vacated, the building official shall post a notice at each entrance that reads as follows:

“This Building (or Structure) is Unsafe and its Occupancy (or Use) is Prohibited by the Building Official.”

After posting, occupancy or use of the unsafe building or structure shall be prohibited except when authorized to

enter to conduct inspections, make required repairs, or as necessary to demolish the building or structure.

**118.4 Posting of notice.**

The notice shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the last known address of the responsible party and a copy of
the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.

**118.5 Posting of placard.**

In the case of an unsafe building or structure, if the notice is not complied with, a placard with the following wording shall
be posted at the entrance to the building or structure:

“This Building (or Structure) is Unfit for Habitation and its Use or Occupancy has been Prohibited by the Building

Official.”

After an unsafe building or structure is placarded, entering the unsafe building or structure shall be prohibited except

as authorized by the building official to make inspections, to perform required repairs, or to demolish the unsafe building
or structure. In addition, the placard shall not be removed until the unsafe building or structure is determined by the
building official to be safe to occupy. The placard shall not be defaced.

To the extent permitted by the locality, the building official may authorize emergency repairs or securing of the site when
it is determined that there is an imminent threat to the life and safety of the public. The building official shall be
permitted to authorize the necessary work to make the structure temporarily safe whether or not legal action to compel
compliance has been instituted.

In addition, if the notice of violation included an order to demolish the structure and the demolition has not occurred

in the time period stipulated, the building official shall be permitted to cause the unsafe structure to be demolished. In
accordance with §§ 15.2-906 and 15.2-1115 of the Code of Virginia, the legal counsel of the locality may be requested to
institute appropriate action against the property owner to recover the costs associated with any such emergency repairs
or demolition and every such charge that remains unpaid shall constitute a lien against the property on which the
emergency repairs or demolition were made and shall be enforceable in the same manner as provided in Articles 3 (§
58.1-3940 et seq.) and 4 (§ 58.1-3965 et seq.) of Chapter 39 of Title 58.1 of the Code of Virginia.
