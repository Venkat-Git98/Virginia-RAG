# CHAPTER 4 SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON USE AND OCCUPANCY

 SECTION 409
 MOTION PICTURE PROJECTION ROOMS

**409.1 General.**


[The provisions of Sections 409.1 through 409.5 shall apply to rooms in which ribbon-type cellulose acetate or other safety](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch04_Sec409.1)
film is utilized in conjunction with electric arc, xenon or other light-source projection equipment that develops hazardous
[gases, dust or radiation. Where cellulose nitrate film is utilized or stored, such rooms shall comply with NFPA 40.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromNFPA_RefStd40_19)


**409.1.1 Projection room required.**


Every motion picture machine projecting film as mentioned within the scope of this section shall be enclosed in a
projection room. Appurtenant electrical equipment, such as rheostats, transformers and generators, shall be within the
projection room or in an adjacent room of equivalent construction.

**409.2 Construction of projection rooms.**

Every projection room shall be of permanent construction consistent with the construction requirements for the type of
building in which the projection room is located. Openings are not required to be protected.

The room shall have a floor area of not less than 80 square feet (7.44 m ) for a single machine and not less than 402


square feet (3.7 m ) for each additional machine. Each motion picture projector, floodlight, spotlight or similar piece of2
equipment shall have a clear working space of not less than 30 inches by 30 inches (762 mm by 762 mm) on each side
and at the rear thereof, but only one such space shall be required between two adjacent projectors. The projection room
and the rooms appurtenant thereto shall have a ceiling height of not less than 7 feet 6 inches (2286 mm). The aggregate
of openings for projection equipment shall not exceed 25 percent of the area of the wall between the projection room and
the auditorium. Openings shall be provided with glass or other approved material, so as to close completely the opening.


**409.3 Projection room and equipment ventilation.**

_[Ventilation shall be provided in accordance with the International Mechanical Code.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIMC_21)_

**409.3.1 Supply air.**


Each projection room shall be provided with adequate air supply inlets so arranged as to provide well-distributed air
throughout the room. Air inlet ducts shall provide an amount of air equivalent to the amount of air being exhausted by
projection equipment. Air is permitted to be taken from the outside; from adjacent spaces within the building, provided
that the volume and infiltration rate are sufficient; or from the building air-conditioning system, provided that it is so
arranged as to provide sufficient air when other systems are not in operation.

**409.3.2 Exhaust air.**

Projection rooms are permitted to be exhausted through the lamp exhaust system. The lamp exhaust system shall be
positively interconnected with the lamp so that the lamp will not operate unless there is the required airflow. Exhaust air
ducts shall terminate at the exterior of the building in such a location that the exhaust air cannot be readily recirculated
into any air supply system. The projection room ventilation system is permitted to also serve appurtenant rooms, such as
the generator and rewind rooms.

**409.3.3 Projection machines.**

Each projection machine shall be provided with an exhaust duct that will draw air from each lamp and exhaust it directly
to the outside of the building. The lamp exhaust is permitted to serve to exhaust air from the projection room to provide
room air circulation. Such ducts shall be of rigid materials, except for a flexible connector approved for the purpose. The
projection lamp or projection room exhaust system, or both, is permitted to be combined but shall not be interconnected
with any other exhaust or return system, or both, within the building.

**409.4 Lighting control.**

Provisions shall be made for control of the auditorium lighting and the means of egress lighting systems of theaters from
inside the projection room and from not less than one other convenient point in the building.

**409.5 Miscellaneous equipment.**

Each projection room shall be provided with rewind and film storage facilities.
