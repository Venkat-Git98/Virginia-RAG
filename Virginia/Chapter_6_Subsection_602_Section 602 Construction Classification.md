 SECTION 602
 CONSTRUCTION CLASSIFICATION


**602.1 General.**


Buildings and structures erected or to be erected, altered or extended in height or area shall be classified in one of the
[five construction types defined in Sections 602.2 through 602.5. The building elements shall have a fire-resistance rating](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch06_Sec602.2)
[not less than that specified in Table 601 and exterior walls shall have a fire-resistance rating not less than that specified](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch06_Sec601_Tbl601)
[in Table 705.5. Where required to have a fire-resistance rating by Table 601, building elements shall comply with the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec705.5_Tbl705.5)

**602.1.1 Minimum requirements.**


A building or portion thereof shall not be required to conform to the details of a type of construction higher than that type
which meets the minimum requirements based on occupancy even though certain features of such a building actually
conform to a higher type of construction.


**602.2 Types I and II.**


Types I and II construction are those types of construction in which the _[building elements specified in Table 601 are of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch06_Sec601_Tbl601)_
