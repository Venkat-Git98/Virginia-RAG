# CHAPTER 1 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION 104
 ENFORCEMENT, GENERALLY


**104.1 Scope of enforcement.**


This section establishes the requirements for enforcement of the USBC in accordance with § 36-105 of the Code of
Virginia. Enforcement of the provisions of the USBC for construction and rehabilitation shall be the responsibility of the
_local building department. Whenever a county or municipality does not have such a building department, the local_
_governing body shall enter into an agreement with the local governing body of another county or municipality or with_
some other agency, or a state agency approved by DHCD for such enforcement. For the purposes of this section, towns
with a population of less than 3,500 may elect to administer and enforce the USBC; however, where the town does not
elect to administer and enforce the code, the county in which the town is situated shall administer and enforce the code
for the town. In the event such town is situated in two or more counties, those counties shall administer and enforce the
USBC for that portion of the town situated within their respective boundaries.

However, upon a finding by the local building department, following a complaint by a tenant of a residential dwelling

unit that is the subject of such complaint, that there may be a violation of the unsafe structures provisions of Part III of
[the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, also known as the “Virginia Property Maintenance Code,” or the “VPMC,”](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VAPMC%E2%80%9421)
the local building department shall enforce such provisions.

[If the local building department receives a complaint that a violation of the VPMC exists that is an immediate and](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VAPMC%E2%80%9421)

imminent threat to the health or safety of the owner, tenant, or occupants of any building or structure, or the owner,
occupant, or tenant of any nearby building or structure, and the owner, occupant, or tenant of the building or structure
that is the subject of the complaint has refused to allow the local building official or his agent to have access to the
subject building or structure, the local building official or his agent may make an affidavit under oath before a magistrate
or a court of competent jurisdiction and request that the magistrate or court grant the local building official or his agent
an inspection warrant to enable the building official or his agent to enter the subject building or structure for the purpose
of determining whether violations of the VPMC exist. After issuing a warrant under this section, the magistrate or judge
shall file the affidavit in the manner prescribed by § 19.2-54 of the Code of Virginia. After executing the warrant, the local
building official or his agents shall return the warrant to the clerk of the circuit court of the city or county wherein the
inspection was made. The local building official or his agent shall make a reasonable effort to obtain consent from the
_owner, occupant, or tenant of the subject building or structure prior to seeking the issuance of an inspection warrant_
under this section.

[The local governing body shall, however, inspect and enforce the provisions of the VPMC for elevators, escalators, and](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VAPMC%E2%80%9421)

related conveyances, except for elevators in single-family and two-family homes and townhouses. Such inspection and
enforcement shall be carried out by an agency or department designated by the local governing body.

**104.2 Interagency coordination.**

When any inspection functions under this code are assigned to a local agency other than the local building department,
such agency shall coordinate its reports of inspection with the local building department.
