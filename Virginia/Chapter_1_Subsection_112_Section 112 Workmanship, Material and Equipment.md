# CHAPTER 1 ADMINISTRATION

 SECTION 112
 WORKMANSHIP, MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT


**112.1 General.**


It shall be the duty of any person performing work covered by this code to comply with all applicable provisions of this
code and to perform and complete such work so as to secure the results intended by the USBC. Damage to regulated
building components caused by violations of this code or by the use of faulty materials or installations shall be considered
[as separate violations of this code and shall be subject to the applicable provisions of Section 115.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01_Sec115)


**112.2 Alternative methods or materials.**


In accordance with § 36-99 of the Code of Virginia, where practical, the provisions of this code are stated in terms of
required level of performance so as to facilitate the prompt acceptance of new building materials and methods. When
generally recognized standards of performance are not available, this section and other applicable requirements of this
code provide for acceptance of materials and methods whose performance is substantially equal in safety to those
specified on the basis of reliable test and evaluation data presented by the proponent. In addition, as a requirement of
this code, the building official shall require that sufficient technical data be submitted to substantiate the proposed use of
any material, equipment, device, assembly or method of construction. The building official may consider nationally
recognized guidelines in making a determination.


**112.3 Documentation and approval.**


In determining whether any material, equipment, device, assembly or method of construction complies with this code,
the building official shall approve items listed by nationally recognized testing laboratories, when such items are listed for
the intended use and application, and in addition, may consider the recommendations of RDPs. Approval shall be issued
when the building official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of
this code and that the material, equipment, device, assembly or method of construction offered is, for the purpose
intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed by the code. Such approval is subject to all applicable requirements of
this code and the material, equipment, device, assembly or method of construction shall be installed in accordance with
the conditions of the approval and their listings. In addition, the building official may revoke such approval whenever it is
discovered that such approval was issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information, or where there are repeated
violations of the USBC.

**112.3.1 Conditions of listings.**

Where conflicts between this code and conditions of the listing or the manufacturer’s installation instructions occur, the
provisions of this code shall apply.

**Exception: Where a code provision is less restrictive than the conditions of the listing of the equipment or appliance**
or the manufacturer’s installation instructions, the conditions of the listing and the manufacturer’s installation
instructions shall apply.


**112.4 Used material and equipment.**


Used materials, equipment and devices may be approved, provided they have been reconditioned, tested or examined
and found to be in good and proper working condition and acceptable for use by the building official.


**112.5 Defective materials.**


Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, where action has been taken and completed by the Board of
Housing and Community Development (BHCD) under subsection D of § 36-99 of the Code of Virginia establishing new
performance standards for identified defective materials, this section sets forth the new performance standards
addressing the prospective use of such materials and establishes remediation standards for the removal of any defective
materials already installed, which when complied with enables the building official to certify that the building is deemed
to comply with the edition of the USBC under which the building was originally constructed with respect to the
remediation of the defective materials.


**112.5.1 Drywall, performance standard.**

[All newly installed gypsum wallboard shall not be defective drywall as defined in Section 112.5.1.1.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01_Sec112.5.1.1.1)

**112.5.1.1 Remediation standards.**

The following provisions establish remediation standards where defective drywall was installed in buildings.

**112.5.1.1.1 Definition.**


For the purposes of this section the term “defective drywall” means gypsum wallboard that (i) contains elemental sulfur
