# CHAPTER 9 FIRE PROTECTION AND LIFE SAFETY SYSTEMS

 SECTION 909
 SMOKE CONTROL SYSTEMS

**[F] 909.1 Scope and purpose.**


This section applies to mechanical or passive smoke control systems where they are required by other provisions of this
code. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum requirements for the design, installation and acceptance
testing of smoke control systems that are intended to provide a tenable environment for the evacuation or relocation of
occupants. These provisions are not intended for the preservation of contents, the timely restoration of operations or for
assistance in fire suppression or overhaul activities. Smoke control systems regulated by this section serve a different
[purpose than the smoke- and heat-removal provisions found in Section 910. Mechanical smoke control systems shall not](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec910)
[be considered exhaust systems under Chapter 5 of the International Mechanical Code.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IMC2021P1_Ch05)

**[F] 909.2 General design requirements.**

Buildings, structures or parts thereof required by this code to have a smoke control system or systems shall have such
[systems designed in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 909 and the generally accepted and well-](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec909)
established principles of engineering relevant to the design. The construction documents shall include sufficient
information and detail to adequately describe the elements of the design necessary for the proper implementation of the
smoke control systems. These documents shall be accompanied by sufficient information and analysis to demonstrate
compliance with these provisions.

**[F] 909.3 Special inspection and test requirements.**

In addition to the ordinary inspection and test requirements that buildings, structures and parts thereof are required to
[undergo, smoke control systems subject to the provisions of Section 909 shall undergo special inspections and tests](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec909)
sufficient to verify the proper commissioning of the smoke control design in its final installed condition. The design
submission accompanying the construction documents shall clearly detail procedures and methods to be used and the
items subject to such inspections and tests. Such commissioning shall be in accordance with generally accepted
engineering practice and, where possible, based on published standards for the particular testing involved. The special
_[inspections and tests required by this section shall be conducted under the same terms in Section 1704.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1704)_



**[F] 909.4 Analysis.**


A rational analysis supporting the types of smoke control systems to be employed, their methods of operation, the
systems supporting them and the methods of construction to be utilized shall accompany the submitted construction
_[documents and shall include, but not be limited to, the items indicated in Sections 909.4.1 through 909.4.7.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec909.4.1)_

**[F] 909.4.1 Stack effect.**

The system shall be designed such that the maximum probable normal or reverse stack effect will not adversely interfere
with the system’s capabilities. In determining the maximum probable stack effect, altitude, elevation, weather history
and interior temperatures shall be used.

**[F] 909.4.2 Temperature effect of fire.**

[Buoyancy and expansion caused by the design fire in accordance with Section 909.9 shall be analyzed. The system shall](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec909.9)
be designed such that these effects do not adversely interfere with the system’s capabilities.

**[F] 909.4.3 Wind effect.**

The design shall consider the adverse effects of wind. Such consideration shall be consistent with the wind-loading
[provisions of Chapter 16.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16)

**[F] 909.4.4 HVAC systems.**

The design shall consider the effects of the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems on both smoke and
fire transport. The analysis shall include all permutations of systems status. The design shall consider the effects of the
fire on the HVAC systems.

**[F] 909.4.5 Climate.**

The design shall consider the effects of low temperatures on systems, property and occupants. Air inlets and exhausts
shall be located so as to prevent snow or ice blockage.



**[F] 909.4.6 Duration of operation.**


All portions of active or engineered smoke control systems shall be capable of continued operation after detection of the
fire event for a period of not less than either 20 minutes or 1.5 times the calculated egress time, whichever is greater.

**[F] 909.4.7 Smoke control system interaction.**

The design shall consider the interaction effects of the operation of multiple smoke control systems for all design

2. Only the AUTO position of each three-position fire-fighter’s control panel switch shall allow automatic or manual

control action from other control points within the building. The AUTO position shall be the NORMAL, nonemergency,
building control position. Where a fire fighter’s control panel is in the AUTO position, the actual status of the device
[(on, off, open, closed) shall continue to be indicated by the status indicator described in Section 909.16.1. Where](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec909.16.1)
directed by an automatic signal to assume an emergency condition, the NORMAL position shall become the
emergency condition for that device or group of devices within the zone. Control actions shall not require the smoke
control system to assume more than one configuration at any one time.



**[F] 909.17 System response time.**


Smoke-control system activation shall be initiated immediately after receipt of an appropriate automatic or manual
activation command. Smoke control systems shall activate individual components (such as dampers and fans) in the
sequence necessary to prevent physical damage to the fans, dampers, ducts and other equipment. For purposes of
smoke control, the fire fighter’s control panel response time shall be the same for automatic or manual smoke control
action initiated from any other building control point. The total response time, including that necessary for detection,
shutdown of operating equipment and smoke control system startup, shall allow for full operational mode to be achieved
before the conditions in the space exceed the design smoke condition. Upon receipt of an alarm condition at the fire
alarm control panel, fans, dampers and automatic doors shall have achieved their proper operating state and the final
status shall be indicated at the smoke control panel within 90 seconds. The system response time for each component
and their sequential relationships shall be detailed in the required rational analysis and verification of their installed
condition reported in the required final report.



**[F] 909.18 Acceptance testing.**


Devices, equipment, components and sequences shall be individually tested. These tests, in addition to those required by
other provisions of this code, shall consist of determination of function, sequence and, where applicable, capacity of their
installed condition.



**[F] 909.18.1 Detection devices.**


[Smoke or fire detectors that are a part of a smoke control system shall be tested in accordance with Chapter 9 in their](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09)
installed condition. Where applicable, this testing shall include verification of airflow in both minimum and maximum
conditions.

Fans shall be examined for correct rotation. Measurements of voltage, amperage, revolutions per minute (rpm) and belt
tension shall be made.

**[F] 909.18.6 Smoke barriers.**

Measurements using inclined manometers or other approved calibrated measuring devices shall be made of the pressure
differences across smoke barriers. Such measurements shall be conducted for each possible smoke control condition.

**[F] 909.18.7 Controls.**

Each smoke zone equipped with an automatic-initiation device shall be put into operation by the actuation of one such
device. Each additional device within the zone shall be verified to cause the same sequence without requiring the
operation of fan motors in order to prevent damage. Control sequences shall be verified throughout the system, including
verification of override from the fire fighter’s control panel and simulation of standby power conditions.

**[F] 909.18.8 Testing for smoke control.**

[Smoke control systems shall be tested by a special inspector in accordance with Section 1705.19.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1705.19)
