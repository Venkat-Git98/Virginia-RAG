**510.3 Group S-2 enclosed parking garage with Group S-2 open parking garage above.**


A Group S-2 enclosed parking garage with not more than one story above grade plane and located below a Group S-2
_open parking garage shall be classified as a separate and distinct building for the purpose of determining the type of_

number of stories to be used in determining the minimum type of construction shall be measured from the floor above
such a parking area. The floor assembly between the parking garage and the Group R above shall comply with the type of
construction required for the parking garage and shall also provide a fire-resistance rating not less than the mixed
[occupancy separation required in Section 508.4.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch05_Sec508.4)
