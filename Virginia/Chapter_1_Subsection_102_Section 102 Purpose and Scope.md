supersede proffered conditions accepted as a part of a rezoning application, conditions imposed upon the grant of special
exceptions, special or conditional use permits or variances, conditions imposed upon a clustering of single-family homes
and preservation of open space development through standards, conditions, and criteria established by a locality
pursuant to subdivision 8 of § 15.2-2242 of the Code of Virginia or § 15.2-2286.1 of the Code of Virginia, or land use
requirements in airport or highway overlay districts, or historic districts created pursuant to § 15.2-2306 of the Code of
