 GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS


**1604.1 General.**

Building, structures and parts thereof shall be designed and constructed in accordance with strength design, load and
_resistance factor design, allowable stress design, empirical design or conventional construction methods, as permitted by_
the applicable material chapters and referenced standards.

**1604.2 Strength.**

Buildings and other structures, and parts thereof, shall be designed and constructed to support safely the factored loads
in load combinations defined in this code without exceeding the appropriate strength limit states for the materials of
construction. Alternatively, buildings and other structures, and parts thereof, shall be designed and constructed to
support safely the nominal loads in load combinations defined in this code without exceeding the appropriate specified
allowable stresses for the materials of construction.

Loads and forces for occupancies or uses not covered in this chapter shall be subject to the approval of the building

_official._

**1604.3 Serviceability.**

Structural systems and members thereof shall be designed to have adequate stiffness to limit deflections as indicated in
[Table 1604.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1604.3_Tbl1604.3)

# short-term live load deflection. For lumber, structural glued laminated timber, prefabricated wood I-joists and structural composite lumber members that are dry at time of installation and used under dry conditions in accordance with the ANSI/AWC NDS, the creep component of the long-term deflection shall be permitted to be estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from 0.5D. For lumber and glued laminated timber members installed or used at all other moisture conditions or cross laminated timber and wood structural panels that are dry at time of installation and used under dry conditions in accordance with the ANSI/AWC NDS, the creep component of the long-term deflection is permitted to be estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from D. The value of 0.5D shall not be used in combination with ANSI/AWC NDS provisions for long-term loading.

 e. The preceding deflections do not ensure against ponding. Roofs that do not have
 sufficient slope or camber to ensure adequate drainage shall be investigated for ponding. See Chapter 8 of ASCE 7.

 f. The wind load shall be permitted to be taken as 0.42 times the “component and
 cladding” loads or directly calculated using the 10-year mean return interval wind speed for the purpose of determining deflection limits in Table 1604.3. Where framing members support glass, the deflection limit therein shall not exceed that specified in Section 1604.3.7

 g. For steel structural members, the deflection due to creep component of long-term
 dead load shall be permitted to be taken as zero.

 h. For aluminum structural members or aluminum panels used in skylights and
 sloped glazing framing, roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers not supporting edge of glass or aluminum sandwich panels, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/60. For continuous aluminum structural members supporting edge of glass, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/175 for each glass lite or l/60 for the entire length of the member, whichever is more stringent. For aluminum sandwich panels used in roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, the total load deflection shall not exceed 1/120.

 i. l = Length of the member between supports. For cantilever members, l shall be
 taken as twice the length of the cantilever.

**1604.3.1 Deflections.**

[The deflections of structural members shall not exceed the more restrictive of the limitations of Sections 1604.3.2](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1604.3.2)

**1604.3.7 Framing supporting glass.**

The deflection of framing members supporting glass subjected to 0.6 times the “component and cladding” wind loads
shall not exceed either of the following:

1. 1 175/ of the length of span of the framing member, for framing members having a length not more than 13 feet 6

inches (4115 mm).


2. 1 240/ of the length of span of the framing member + / inch (6.4 mm), for framing members having a length1 4

greater than 13 feet 6 inches (4115 mm).

**1604.4 Analysis.**

_Load effects on structural members and their connections shall be determined by methods of structural analysis that_
take into account equilibrium, general stability, geometric compatibility and both short- and longterm material properties.

Members that tend to accumulate residual deformations under repeated service loads shall have included in their

analysis the effects of added deformations expected to occur during their service life.

Any system or method of construction to be used shall be based on a rational analysis in accordance with well
established principles of mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system that provides a complete load path capable of
transferring loads from their point of origin to the load-resisting elements.

The total lateral force shall be distributed to the various vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system in

proportion to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the horizontal bracing system or diaphragm. Rigid elements
assumed not to be a part of the lateral force-resisting system are permitted to be incorporated into buildings provided
that their effect on the action of the system is considered and provided for in the design. A diaphragm is rigid for the
purpose of distribution of story shear and torsional moment when the lateral deformation of the diaphragm is less than or
equal to two times the average story drift. Where required by ASCE 7, provisions shall be made for the increased forces
induced on resisting elements of the structural system resulting from torsion due to eccentricity between the center of
application of the lateral forces and the center of rigidity of the lateral force-resisting system.

Every structure shall be designed to resist the effects caused by the forces specified in this chapter, including


overturning, uplift and sliding. Where sliding is used to isolate the elements, the effects of friction between sliding
elements shall be included as a force.


**1604.5 Risk category.**


[Each building and structure shall be assigned a risk category in accordance with Table 1604.5. Where a reference](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1604.5_Tbl1604.5)
standard specifies an occupancy category, the risk category shall not be taken as lower than the occupancy
categoryspecified therein. Where a referenced standard specifies that the assignment of a risk category be in accordance
[with ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1, Table 1604.5 shall be used in lieu of ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

**Exception: The assignment of buildings and structures to Tsunami** _Risk Categories III and IV is permitted to be in_
[accordance with Section 6.4 of ASCE 7.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
