# CHAPTER 12 INTERIOR ENVIRONMENT

 SECTION 1206
 SOUND TRANSMISSION


**1206.1 Scope.**


[Sections 1206.2 and 1206.3 shall apply to common interior walls, partitions and floor or ceiling assemblies between](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch12_Sec1206.2)
adjacent dwelling units or between dwelling units and adjacent public areas such as halls, corridors, stairs or service
[areas. Section 1206.4 applies to the construction of the exterior envelope of Group R occupancies within airport noise](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch12_Sec1206.4)
zones and to the exterior envelope of Groups A, B, E, I and M occupancies in any locality in whose jurisdiction, or adjacent
jurisdiction, is located a United States Master Jet Base, a licensed airport or United States government or military air
facility, when such requirements are enforced by a locality pursuant to § 15.2-2295 of the Code of Virginia.


**1206.2 Airborne sound.**


Walls, partitions and floor-ceiling assemblies separating _dwelling units and sleeping units from each other or from public_
[or service areas shall have a sound transmission class of not less than 50 where tested in accordance with ASTM E90,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE90_2009_2016)
[or have a Normalized Noise Isolation Class (NNIC) rating of not less than 45 if field tested, in accordance with ASTM E336](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE336_19a)
for airborne noise. Alternatively, the sound transmission class of walls, partitions and floor-ceiling assemblies shall be
established by engineering analysis based on a comparison of walls, partitions and floor-ceiling assemblies having _sound_
_[transmission class ratings as determined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E90. Penetrations or openings in](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE90_2009_2016)_
construction assemblies for piping; electrical devices; recessed cabinets; bathtubs; soffits; or heating, ventilating or
exhaust ducts shall be sealed, lined, insulated or otherwise treated to maintain the required ratings. This requirement
shall not apply to entrance doors; however, such doors shall be tight fitting to the frame and sill.


**1206.2.1 Masonry.**


The sound transmission class of concrete masonry and clay masonry assemblies shall be calculated in accordance with
[TMS 302 or determined through testing in accordance with ASTM E90.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromTMS_RefStd302_2018)


**1206.3 Structure-borne sound.**


Floor-ceiling assemblies between dwelling units and sleeping units or between a dwelling unit or sleeping unit and a
public or service area within the structure shall have an impact insulation class rating of not less than 50 where tested in
[accordance with ASTM E492, or have a Normalized Impact Sound Rating (NISR) of not less than 45 if field tested in](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE492_2009_2016_E1)
[accordance with ASTM E1007. Alternatively, the impact insulation class of floor-ceiling assemblies shall be established by](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE1007_19)
engineering analysis based on a comparison of floor-ceiling assemblies having impact insulation class ratings as
[determined by the test procedures in ASTM E492.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE492_2009_2016_E1)


**1206.4 Airport noise attenuation standards.**


Where the daynight average sound level (Ldn) is determined to be 65 dBA or greater, the minimum STC rating of
[structure components shall be provided in compliance with Table 1206.4. As an alternative to compliance with Table](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch12_Sec1206.4_Tbl1206.4)
1206.4, structures shall be permitted to be designed and constructed so as to limit the interior noise level to no greater
than 45 Ldn. Exterior structures, terrain and permanent plantings shall be permitted to be included as part of the
alternative design. The alternative design shall be certified by a registered design professional (RDP).

|Ldn|STC OF EXTERIOR WALLS AND ROOF/ CEILING ASSEMBLIES|STC OF DOORS AND WINDOWS|
|---|---|---|
|65–69|39|25|
|70–74|44|33|
|75 or greater|49|38|
