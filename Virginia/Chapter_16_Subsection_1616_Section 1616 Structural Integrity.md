# CHAPTER 16 STRUCTURAL DESIGN

 SECTION 1616
 STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY


**1616.1 General.**


_[High-rise buildings that are assigned to Risk Category III or IV shall comply with the requirements of Section 1616.2 if](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1616.2)_
[they are frame structures, or Section 1616.3 if they are bearing wall structures.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1616.3)


**1616.2 Frame structures.**

_Frame structures shall comply with the requirements of this section._

**1616.2.1 Concrete frame structures.**


_Frame structures constructed primarily of reinforced or prestressed concrete, either cast-in-place or precast, or a_
[combination of these, shall conform to the requirements of Section 4.10 of ACI 318. Where ACI 318 requires that](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromACI_RefStd318_19)
nonprestressed reinforcing or prestressing steel pass through the region bounded by the longitudinal column
reinforcement, that reinforcing or prestressing steel shall have a minimum nominal tensile strength equal to two-thirds of
the required one-way vertical strength of the connection of the floor or roof system to the column in each direction of
beam or slab reinforcement passing through the column.

**Exception: Where concrete slabs with continuous reinforcement having an area not less than 0.0015 times the**
concrete area in each of two orthogonal directions are present and are either monolithic with or equivalently bonded
to beams, girders or columns, the longitudinal reinforcing or prestressing steel passing through the column
reinforcement shall have a nominal tensile strength of one-third of the required one-way vertical strength of the
connection of the floor or roof system to the column in each direction of beam or slab reinforcement passing through
the column.


**1616.2.2 Structural steel, open web steel joist or joist girder, or composite steel and concrete frame**
**_structures._**


_Frame structures constructed with a structural steel frame or a frame composed of open web steel joists, joist girders_
with or without other structural steel elements or a frame composed of composite steel or composite steel joists and
reinforced concrete elements shall conform to the requirements of this section.


**1616.2.2.1 Columns.**


Each column splice shall have the minimum design strength in tension to transfer the design dead and live load tributary
to the column between the splice and the splice or base immediately below.


**1616.2.2.2 Beams.**


End connections of all beams and girders shall have a minimum nominal axial tensile strength equal to the required
vertical shear strength for allowable stress design (ASD) or two-thirds of the required shear strength for load and
_resistance factor design ( LRFD) but not less than 10 kips (45 kN). For the purpose of this section, the shear force and the_
axial tensile force need not be considered to act simultaneously.

**Exception: Where beams, girders, open web joist and joist girders support a concrete slab or concrete slab on metal**
deck that is attached to the beam or girder with not less than 3/8-inch-diameter (9.5 mm) headed shear studs, at a
spacing of not more than 12 inches (305 mm) on center, averaged over the length of the member, or other
attachment having equivalent shear strength, and the slab contains continuous distributed reinforcement in each of
two orthogonal directions with an area not less than 0.0015 times the concrete area, the nominal axial tension
strength of the end connection shall be permitted to be taken as half the required vertical shear strength for ASD or
one-third of the required shear strength for LRFD, but not less than 10 kips (45 kN).


**1616.3 Bearing wall structures.**


_Bearing wall structures shall have vertical ties in all load-bearing walls and longitudinal ties, transverse ties and_
[perimeter ties at each floor level in accordance with this section and as shown in Figure 1616.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1616.3_Fig1616.3)

**1616.3.1 Concrete wall structures.**

Precast bearing wall structures constructed solely of reinforced or prestressed concrete, or combinations of these shall
[conform to the requirements of Sections 16.2.4 and 16.2.5 of ACI 318.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromACI_RefStd318_19)

**1616.3.2 Other bearing wall structures.**

[Ties in bearing wall structures other than those covered in Section 1616.3.1 shall conform to this section.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1616.3.1)

**1616.3.2.1 Longitudinal ties.**

Longitudinal ties shall consist of continuous reinforcement in slabs; continuous or spliced decks or sheathing; continuous
or spliced members framing to, within or across walls; or connections of continuous framing members to walls.
Longitudinal ties shall extend across interior load-bearing walls and shall connect to exterior load-bearing walls and shall
be spaced at not greater than 10 feet (3038 mm) on center. Ties shall have a minimum nominal tensile strength, T,T
[given by Equation 16-24. For ASD the minimum nominal tensile strength shall be permitted to be taken as 1.5 times the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1616.3.2.1_Eq1)
allowable tensile stress times the area of the tie.


where:

_L = The span of the horizontal element in the direction of the tie, between bearing walls, feet (m)._


**(Equation 16-24)**


_w = The weight per unit area of the floor or roof in the span being tied to or across the wall, psf (N/m).2_

_S = The spacing between ties, feet (m)._


_αT = A coefficient with a value of 1,500 pounds per foot (2.25 kN/m) for masonry bearing wall structures and a value_
of 375 pounds per foot (0.6 kN/m) for structures with bearing walls of cold-formed steel light-frame construction.


**1616.3.2.2 Transverse ties.**


Transverse ties shall consist of continuous reinforcement in slabs; continuous or spliced decks or sheathing; continuous
or spliced members framing to, within or across walls; or connections of continuous framing members to walls.
Transverse ties shall be placed not farther apart than the spacing of _load-bearing walls. Transverse ties shall have_
minimum nominal tensile strength T, given by T [Equation 16-24. For ASD the minimum nominal tensile strength shall be](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1616.3.2.1_Eq1)
permitted to be taken as 1.5 times the allowable tensile stress times the area of the tie.


**1616.3.2.3 Perimeter ties.**


Perimeter ties shall consist of continuous reinforcement in slabs; continuous or spliced decks or sheathing; continuous or
spliced members framing to, within or across walls; or connections of continuous framing members to walls. Ties around
the perimeter of each floor and roof shall be located within 4 feet (1219 mm) of the edge and shall provide a nominal
strength in tension not less than T, given by p [Equation 16-25. For ASD the minimum nominal tensile strength shall be](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1616.3.2.3_Eq1)
permitted to be taken as 1.5 times the allowable tensile stress times the area of the tie.


For SI: T = 90.7p _w ≤ βT_

Vertical ties shall consist of continuous or spliced reinforcing, continuous or spliced members, wall sheathing or other
engineered systems. Vertical tension ties shall be provided in bearing walls and shall be continuous over the height of the
