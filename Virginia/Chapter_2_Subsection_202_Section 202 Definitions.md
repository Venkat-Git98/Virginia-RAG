**[BF] EXPANDED VINYL WALL COVERING.** Wall covering consisting of a woven textile backing, an expanded vinyl
base coat layer and a nonexpanded vinyl skin coat. The expanded base coat layer is a homogeneous vinyl layer that
contains a blowing agent. During processing, the blowing agent decomposes, causing this layer to expand by forming
closed cells. The total thickness of the wall covering is approximately 0.055 inch to 0.070 inch (1.4 mm to 1.78 mm).

**[F] EXPLOSION. An effect produced by the sudden violent expansion of gases, which may be accompanied by a shock**
wave or disruption, or both, of enclosing materials or structures. An explosion could result from any of the following:

1. Chemical changes such as rapid oxidation, deflagration or detonation, decomposition of molecules and runaway


polymerization (usually detonations).

2. Physical changes such as pressure tank ruptures.

3. Atomic changes (nuclear fission or fusion).

**[F] EXPLOSIVE. A chemical compound, mixture or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to function by**
explosion. The term includes, but is not limited to: dynamite, black powder, pellet powder, initiating explosives,
detonators, safety fuses, squibs, detonating cord, igniter cord, and igniters. The term “explosive” includes any material
[determined to be within the scope of USC Title 18: Chapter 40 and also includes any material classified as an explosive](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromUSC_RefStd18_USC_Part_1_Ch_40)
[other than consumer fireworks, 1.4G by the hazardous materials regulations of DOTn 49 CFR Parts 100-185.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromDOTN_RefStd49_CFR_Parts_100_185_2015)

reaction that is less than the speed of sound. Examples of low explosives include, but are not limited to: black
powder; safety fuse; igniters; igniter cord; fuse lighters; fireworks; and propellants, 1.3C.

**Mass-detonating explosives. Division 1.1, 1.2 and 1.5 explosives alone or in combination, or loaded into various**
types of ammunition or containers, most of which can be expected to explode virtually instantaneously when a
small portion is subjected to fire, severe concussion, impact, the impulse of an initiating agent or the effect of a
considerable discharge of energy from without. Materials that react in this manner represent a mass explosion
hazard. Such an explosive will normally cause severe structural damage to adjacent objects. Explosive propagation
could occur immediately to other items of ammunition and explosives stored sufficiently close to and not
adequately protected from the initially exploding pile with a time interval short enough so that two or more
quantities must be considered as one for quantity-distance purposes.

**UN/DOTn Class 1 explosives. The former classification system used by DOTn included the terms “high” and**
“low” explosives as defined herein. The following terms further define explosives under the current system applied
by DOTn for all explosive materials defined as hazard Class 1 materials. Compatibility group letters are used in
concert with the division to specify further limitations on each division noted (i.e., the letter G identifies the
material as a pyrotechnic substance or article containing a pyrotechnic substance and similar materials).

**Division 1.1. Explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the**
entire load instantaneously.


**Division 1.2. Explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard.**

**Division 1.3. Explosives that have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard**
or both, but not a mass explosion hazard.
