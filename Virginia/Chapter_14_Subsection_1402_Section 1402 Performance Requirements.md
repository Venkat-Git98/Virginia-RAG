# CHAPTER 14 EXTERIOR WALLS

 SECTION 1402
 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

**1402.1 General.**

The provisions of this section shall apply to exterior walls, wall coverings and components thereof.

**1402.2 Weather protection.**


_Exterior walls shall provide the building with a weather-resistant exterior wall envelope. The exterior wall envelope shall_
[include flashing, as described in Section 1404.4. The exterior wall envelope shall be designed and constructed in such a](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1404.4)
manner as to prevent the accumulation of water within the wall assembly by providing a water-resistive barrier behind
[the exterior veneer, as described in Section 1403.2, and a means for draining water that enters the assembly to the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1403.2)
exterior. Protection against condensation in the exterior wall assembly shall be provided in accordance with Section
1404.3.


**Exceptions:**


1. A weather-resistant exterior wall envelope shall not be required over concrete or masonry walls designed in

[accordance with Chapters 19 and 21, respectively.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch19)

2. [Compliance with the requirements for a means of drainage, and the requirements of Sections 1403.2 and](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1403.2)

[1404.4, shall not be required for an exterior wall envelope that has been demonstrated through testing to resist](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1404.4)
wind-driven rain, including joints, penetrations and intersections with dissimilar materials, in accordance with
[ASTM E331 under the following conditions:](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE331_2000_2016)

The exterior wall envelope design shall be considered to resist wind-driven rain where the results of testing

indicate that water did not penetrate control joints in the exterior wall envelope, joints at the perimeter of
openings or intersections of terminations with dissimilar materials.

2.1. _Exterior wall envelope test assemblies shall include not fewer than one opening, one control joint, one_

wall/eave interface and one wall sill. Tested openings and penetrations shall be representative of the intended
end-use configuration.

2.2. _Exterior wall envelope test assemblies shall be not less than 4 feet by 8 feet (1219 mm by 2438 mm) in_


size.


2.3. _Exterior wall envelope assemblies shall be tested at a minimum differential pressure of 6.24 pounds per_


square foot (0.297 kN/m ).2

2.4. _Exterior wall envelope assemblies shall be subjected to a minimum test exposure duration of 2 hours._

3. _[Exterior insulation and finish systems (EIFS) complying with Section 1407.4.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1407.4.1)_

**[BS] 1402.3 Structural.**


_Exterior walls, and the associated openings, shall be designed and constructed to resist safely the superimposed loads_
[required by Chapter 16.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16)

**1402.4 Fire resistance.**

_Exterior walls shall be fire-resistance rated as required by other sections of this code with opening protection as required_
[by Chapter 7.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07)

**1402.5 Water-resistive barriers.**

(Section deleted.)

**[BS] 1402.6 Flood resistance.**

[For buildings in flood hazard areas as established in Section 1612.3, exterior walls extending below the elevation required](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1612.3)
[by Section 1612 shall be constructed with flood-damage-resistant materials.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1612)

**[BS] 1402.7 Flood resistance for coastal high-hazard areas and coastal A zones.**

[For buildings in coastal high-hazard areas and coastal A zones as established in Section 1612.3, electrical, mechanical](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1612.3)
and plumbing system components shall not be mounted on or penetrate through exterior walls that are designed to break
away under flood loads.

**1402.8 Air barriers.**

The exterior wall envelope shall be designed and constructed by providing air barriers that comply with the International
_Energy Conservation Code._
