The ground snow load, p, shall be indicated. In areas where the ground snow g _load, p,g_ exceeds 10 pounds per square
foot (psf) (0.479 kN/m ), the following additional information shall also be provided, regardless of whether snow 2 _loads_
govern the design of the roof:


1. Flat-roof snow load, p .f

2. Snow exposure factor, C .e


3. Snow load importance factor, Is .

4. Thermal factor, C .t

5. Slope factor(s), C .s


6. Drift surcharge load(s), p, d where the sum of p and d _p exceeds 20 psf (0.96 kN/m )f_ 2 _._


7. Width of snow drift(s), w.

**1603.1.4** **Wind and tornado design data.**

[The following information related to wind loads, and where required by Section 1609.5 tornado loads, shall be shown,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1609.5)
regardless of whether wind loads govern the design of the lateral force-resisting system of the structure:

1. Basic wind speed, V (mph), tornado speed, V, and allowable stress design wind speed, T _Vasd, as determined in_

[accordance with Section 1609.3.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1609.3.1)

2. _Risk category._

3. [Effective plan area, A for tornado design in accordance with Chapter 32 of ASCE 7.e](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

4. Wind exposure. Applicable wind direction if more than one wind exposure is utilized.

5. Applicable internal pressure coefficients, and applicable tornado internal pressure coefficients.

6. Design wind pressures and their applicable zones with dimensions to be used for exterior component and

cladding materials not specifically designed by the registered design professional responsible for the design of the
structure, pounds per square foot (kN/m ). Where design for tornado loads is required, the design pressures shown2
shall be the maximum of wind or tornado pressures.


**1603.1.5 Earthquake design data.**

The following information related to seismic loads shall be shown, regardless of whether seismic loads govern the design
of the lateral force-resisting system of the structure:

1. _Risk category._
