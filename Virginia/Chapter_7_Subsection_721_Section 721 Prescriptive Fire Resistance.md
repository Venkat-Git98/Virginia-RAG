**722.2.1.1.2 Core spaces filled.**


Where all of the core spaces of hollow-core wall panels are filled with loose-fill material, such as expanded shale, clay or slag, or vermiculite
or perlite, the fire-resistance rating of the wall is the same as that of a solid wall of the same concrete type and of the same overall
thickness.


**722.2.1.1.3 Tapered cross sections.**


The thickness of panels with tapered cross sections shall be that determined at a distance 2t or 6 inches (152 mm), whichever is less, from
the point of minimum thickness, where t is the minimum thickness.


**722.2.1.1.4 Ribbed or undulating surfaces.**

The equivalent thickness of panels with ribbed or undulating surfaces shall be determined by one of the following expressions:

For s ≥ 4t, the thickness to be used shall be t

For s ≤ 2t, the thickness to be used shall be te

For 4t > s > 2 t, the thickness to be used shall be

**FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS OF TWO-WYTHE CONCRETE WALLS**

**722.2.1.2.1 Two or more wythes.**

The fire-resistance rating for wall panels consisting of two or more wythes shall be permitted to be determined by the formula:

where:

_R = The fire endurance of the assembly, minutes._


(Equation 7-4)


_R, R, and R1_ _2_ _[n = The fire endurances of the individual wythes, minutes. Values of Rn[0.59] for use in Equation 7-4 are given in Table](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.2.1_Eq1)_


[722.2.1.2(1). Calculated fire-resistance ratings are shown in Table 722.2.1.2(2).](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.2_Tbl722.2.1.2_2)

**722.2.1.2.2 Foam plastic insulation.**


The fire-resistance ratings of precast concrete wall panels consisting of a layer of foam plastic insulation sandwiched between two wythes of
[concrete shall be permitted to be determined by use of Equation 7-4. Foam plastic insulation with a total thickness of less than 1 inch (25](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.2.1_Eq1)
mm) shall be disregarded. The R value for thickness of foam plastic insulation of 1 inch (25 mm) or greater, for use in the calculation, is 5n
minutes; therefore Rn[0.59] = 2.5.


**722.2.1.3 Joints between precast wall panels.**


Joints between precast concrete wall panels that are not insulated as required by this section shall be considered as openings in walls.
[Uninsulated joints shall be included in determining the percentage of openings permitted by Table 705.8. Where openings are not permitted](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec705.8_Tbl705.8)
or are required by this code to be protected, the provisions of this section shall be used to determine the amount of joint insulation required.
Insulated joints shall not be considered openings for purposes of determining compliance with the allowable percentage of openings in Table
705.8.


**722.2.1.3.1 Ceramic fiber joint protection.**


[Figure 722.2.1.3.1 shows thicknesses of ceramic fiber blankets to be used to insulate joints between precast concrete wall panels for various](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.3.1_Fig722.2.1.3.1)

# a. The actual thickness of Portland cement-sand plaster, provided that it is / inch or less in5 8
 thickness, shall be permitted to be included in determining the equivalent thickness of the masonry for use in Table 722.3.2.

**722.2.1.4.1 Nonfire-exposed side.**

Where the finish of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the side of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of the finish to the total
_fire-resistance rating shall be determined as follows: The thickness of the finish shall first be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness of_
[the finish by the applicable factor determined from Table 722.2.1.4(1)](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.4_Tbl722.2.1.4_1) based on the type of aggregate in the concrete. The corrected
thickness of finish shall then be added to the actual or equivalent thickness of concrete and fire-resistance rating of the concrete and finish
[determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.1_Tbl722.2.1.1)


**722.2.1.4.2 Fire-exposed side.**


Where gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total fire-resistance
_[rating shall be determined as follows: The time assigned to the finish as established by Table 722.2.1.4(2)](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.4_Tbl722.2.1.4_2)_ shall be added to the fire_[resistance rating determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2 for the concrete alone, or to the rating determined](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.1_Tbl722.2.1.1)_
[in Section 722.2.1.4.1 for the concrete and finish on the nonfire-exposed side.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.4.1)


**722.2.1.4.3 Nonsymmetrical assemblies.**


For a wall without finish on one side or having different types or thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation procedures of Sections
[722.2.1.4.1 and 722.2.1.4.2 shall be performed twice, assuming either side of the wall to be the fire-exposed side. The fire-resistance rating](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.2.1.4.2)
of the wall shall not exceed the lower of the two values.

**Exception: For an exterior wall with a fire separation distance greater than 5 feet (1524 mm) the fire shall be assumed to occur on the**
interior side only.


**722.2.1.4.4 Minimum concrete fire-resistance rating.**


Where finishes applied to one or both sides of a concrete wall contribute to the fire-resistance rating, the concrete alone shall provide not less
than one-half of the total required fire-resistance rating. Additionally, the contribution to the fire resistance of the finish on the nonfireexposed side of a load-bearing wall shall not exceed one-half the contribution of the concrete alone.

**722.2.1.4.5 Concrete finishes.**

Finishes on concrete walls that are assumed to contribute to the total fire-resistance rating of the wall shall comply with the installation
[requirements of Section 722.3.2.5.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec722.3.2.5)

**722.2.2 Concrete floor and roof slabs.**
