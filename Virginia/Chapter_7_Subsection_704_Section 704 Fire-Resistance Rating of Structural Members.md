entirely between the top and bottom plates or tracks shall be permitted to have required fire-resistance ratings provided
by the membrane protection provided for the wall.


**704.4.2 Horizontal assemblies.**


_Horizontal assemblies are permitted to be protected with a membrane or ceiling where the membrane or ceiling provides_
[the required fire-resistance rating and is installed in accordance with Section 711.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec711)


**704.5 Truss protection.**


The required thickness and construction of fire-resistance-rated assemblies enclosing trusses shall be based on the
results of full-scale tests or combinations of tests on truss components or on approved calculations based on such tests
that satisfactorily demonstrate that the assembly has the required fire resistance.


**704.6 Attachments to structural members.**


The edges of lugs, brackets, rivets and bolt heads attached to structural members shall be permitted to extend to within
1 inch (25 mm) of the surface of the fire protection.


**704.6.1** **Secondary attachments to structural members.**


Where primary and secondary structural steel members require fire protection, secondary steel attachments to those
structural members shall be protected with the same fire-resistive material and thickness as required for the structural
member. The protection shall extend away from the structural member a distance of not less than 12 inches (305 mm),
or shall be applied to the entire length where the attachment is less than 12 inches (305 mm) long. Where an attachment
is hollow and the ends are open, the fire-resistive material and thickness shall be applied to both exterior and interior of
the hollow steel attachment.

**704.8 Embedments and enclosures.**

Pipes, wires, conduits, ducts or other service facilities shall not be embedded in the required fire protective covering of a
structural member that is required to be individually encased.

**704.9 Impact protection.**

Where the fire protective covering of a structural member is subject to impact damage from moving vehicles, the
handling of merchandise or other activity, the fire protective covering shall be protected by corner guards or by a
substantial jacket of metal or other noncombustible material to a height adequate to provide full protection, but not less
than 5 feet (1524 mm) from the finished floor.


**Exception: Corner protection is not required on concrete columns in parking garages.**

**704.10 Exterior structural members.**


Load-bearing structural members located within the exterior walls or on the outside of a building or structure shall be
provided with the highest fire-resistance rating as determined in accordance with the following:


1. [As required by Table 601 for the type of building element based on the type of construction of the building.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch06_Sec601_Tbl601)

2. [As required by Table 601 for exterior bearing walls based on the type of construction.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch06_Sec601_Tbl601)

3. [As required by Table 705.5 for exterior walls based on the fire separation distance.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec705.5_Tbl705.5)

**704.11 Bottom flange protection.**


Fire protection is not required at the bottom flange of lintels, shelf angles and plates, spanning not more than 6 feet 4
inches (1931 mm) whether part of the primary structural frame or not, and from the bottom flange of lintels, shelf angles
and plates not part of the structural frame, regardless of span.


**704.12 Seismic isolation systems.**


_Fire-resistance ratings for the isolation system shall meet the fire-resistance rating required for the columns, walls or_
[other structural elements in which the isolation system is installed in accordance with Table 601. Isolation systems](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch06_Sec601_Tbl601)
required to have a fire-resistance rating shall be protected with approved materials or construction assemblies designed
to provide the same degree of fire resistance as the structural element in which the system is installed when tested in
