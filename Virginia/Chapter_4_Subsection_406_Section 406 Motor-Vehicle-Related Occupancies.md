the canopy shall be in accordance with the following:

1. The canopy shall meet or exceed Type I construction requirements.

2. Operations located under canopies shall be limited to refueling only.

3. The canopy shall be constructed in a manner that prevents the accumulation of hydrogen gas.

**406.8 Repair garages.**

_[Repair garages shall be constructed in accordance with the International Fire Code and Sections 406.2 and 406.8. This](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIFC_21)_

**[F] 406.8.2 Gas detection system.**


_Repair garages used for repair of vehicles fueled by nonodorized gases including but not limited to hydrogen and_
[nonodorized LNG, shall be provided with a gas detection system that complies with Section 916. The gas detection](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec916)
_system shall be designed to detect leakage of nonodorized gaseous fuel. Where lubrication or chassis service pits are_
provided in garages used for repairing nonodorized LNG-fueled vehicles, gas sensors shall be provided in such pits.

**[F] 406.8.2.1 System activation.**

Activation of a gas detection alarm shall result in all of the following:

1. Initiation of distinct audible and visual alarm signals in the repair garage, where the ventilation system is

interlocked with gas detection.

2. Deactivation of all heating systems located in the repair garage.

3. Activation of the mechanical ventilation system, where the system is interlocked with gas detection.

**[F] 406.8.2.2 Failure of the gas detection system.**

Failure of the gas detection system shall automatically deactivate the heating system, activate the mechanical
ventilation system where the system is interlocked with the gas detection system, and cause a trouble signal to sound at
an approved location.

**[F] 406.8.3 Automatic sprinkler system.**

[A repair garage shall be equipped with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.2.9.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch09_Sec903.2.9.1)
