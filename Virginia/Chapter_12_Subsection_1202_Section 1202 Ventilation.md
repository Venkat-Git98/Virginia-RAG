5.2.6. Framing members and blocking shall not block the free flow of water vapor to the port. Not less than a

2-inch (50 mm) space shall be provided between any blocking and the roof sheathing. Air-permeable insulation
shall be permitted within that space.

5.2.7. The roof slope shall be greater than or equal to 3 units vertical in 12 units horizontal (3:12).

5.2.8. Where only air-permeable insulation is used, it shall be installed directly below the structural roof

sheathing, on top the attic floor, or on top of the ceiling.

5.2.9. Where only air-permeable insulation is used and is installed directly below the structural roof sheathing,

air shall be supplied at a flow rate greater than or equal to 50 cubic feet per minute (23.6 L/s) per 1,000 square
