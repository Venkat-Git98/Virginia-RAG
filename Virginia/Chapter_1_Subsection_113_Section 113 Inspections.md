Upon request of the permit holder, the notice shall reference the USBC section that serves as the basis for the defects
and such defects shall be corrected and reinspected before any work proceeds that would conceal such defects. A record
of all reports of inspections, tests, examinations, discrepancies and approvals issued shall be maintained by the building

individuals or agencies unless there is cause to reject it. Failure to approve a report shall be in writing within 2 working
_days of receiving it stating the reason for the rejection. Reports of inspections conducted by approved third-party_
inspectors or agencies shall be in writing, shall indicate if compliance with the applicable provisions of the USBC have

agency. Reports of inspections conducted for the purpose of verifying compliance with the requirements of the USBC for

on the equipment used to perform the test.

**Note: Photographs, videotapes or other sources of pertinent data or information may be considered as constituting**


such reports and tests.

**113.7.1 Third-party inspectors.**


Each building official charged with the enforcement of the USBC shall have a written policy establishing the minimum
acceptable qualifications for third-party inspectors. The policy shall include the format and time frame required for
submission of reports, any prequalification or preapproval requirements before conducting a third-party inspection and
any other requirements and procedures established by the building official.


**113.7.2 Qualifications.**


In determining third-party inspector qualifications, the building official may consider such items as DHCD inspector
certification, other state or national certifications, state professional registrations, related experience, education and any
other factors that would demonstrate competency and reliability to conduct inspections.


**113.8 Final inspection.**


Upon completion of construction for which a permit was issued, a final inspection shall be conducted to ensure that any
defective work has been corrected and that all work complies with the USBC and has been approved, including any work
[associated with modifications under Section 106.3. The building official shall be permitted to require the electrical service](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01_Sec106.3)
to a building or structure to be energized prior to conducting the final inspection. Approval of the final inspection
indicates that all work associated with the permit complies with this code and the permit is complete. Prior to occupancy
or change of occupancy of a building or structure, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued in accordance with Section
