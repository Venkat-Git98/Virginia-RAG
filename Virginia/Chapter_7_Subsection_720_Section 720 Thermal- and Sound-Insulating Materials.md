# CHAPTER 7 FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES

 SECTION 720
 THERMAL- AND SOUND-INSULATING MATERIALS


**720.1 General.**


Insulating materials shall comply with the requirements of this section. Where a flame spread index or a smoke_[developed index is specified in this section, such index shall be determined in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723. Any](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE84_2018B)_
material that is subject to an increase in flame spread index or smoke-developed index beyond the limits herein
established through the effects of age, moisture or other atmospheric conditions shall not be permitted. Insulating
materials, when tested in accordance with the requirements of this section, shall include facings, when used, such as
vapor retarders, vapor permeable membranes and similar coverings, and all layers of single and multilayer reflective foil
insulation and similar materials.

**Exceptions:**

1. _[Fiberboard insulation shall comply with Chapter 23.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23)_

2. [Foam plastic insulation shall comply with Chapter 26.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26)

3. Duct and pipe insulation and duct and pipe coverings and linings in plenums shall comply with the

_[International Mechanical Code.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#IMC2021P1_Ch35_PromICC_RefStdIMC_21)_

4. [All layers of single and multilayer reflective plastic core insulation shall comply with Section 2614.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2614)

**720.2 Concealed installation.**

Insulating materials, where concealed as installed in buildings of any type of construction, shall have a flame spread
_index of not more than 25 and a smoke-developed index of not more than 450._

**[Exception: Cellulosic fiber loose-fill insulation complying with the requirements of Section 720.6 shall not be required](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec720.6)**
to meet a flame spread index requirement but shall be required to meet a smoke-developed index of not more than
[450 when tested in accordance with CAN/ULC S102.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromULC_RefStdCAN_ULC_S_102_2_2018)


**720.2.1 Facings.**


Where such materials are installed in concealed spaces in buildings of Type III, IV or V construction, the _flame spread and_
smoke-developed limitations do not apply to facings, coverings, and layers of reflective foil insulation that are installed
behind and in substantial contact with the unexposed surface of the ceiling, wall or floor finish.


**[Exception: All layers of single and multilayer reflective plastic core insulation shall comply with Section 2614.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2614)**

**720.3 Exposed installation.**


Insulating materials, where exposed as installed in buildings of any type of construction, shall have a flame spread index
of not more than 25 and a smoke-developed index of not more than 450.

**[Exception: Cellulosic fiber loose-fill insulation complying with the requirements of Section 720.6 shall not be required](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec720.6)**
to meet a flame spread index requirement but shall be required to meet a smoke-developed index of not more than
[450 when tested in accordance with CAN/ULC S102.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromULC_RefStdCAN_ULC_S_102_2_2018)


**720.3.1 Attic floors.**


Exposed insulation materials installed on attic floors shall have a critical radiant flux of not less than 0.12 watt per square
[centimeter when tested in accordance with ASTM E970.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE970_2017)


**720.4 Loose-fill insulation.**


[Loose-fill insulation materials that cannot be mounted in the ASTM E84 or UL 723 apparatus without a screen or artificial](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE84_2018B)
[supports shall comply with the flame spread and smoke-developed limits of Sections 720.2 and 720.3 when tested in](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec720.2)
[accordance with CAN/ULC S102.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromULC_RefStdCAN_ULC_S_102_2_2018)

**Exception: Cellulosic fiber loose-fill insulation shall not be required to meet a flame spread index requirement when**
[tested in accordance with CAN/ULC S102.2, provided that such insulation has a smoke-developed index of not more](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromULC_RefStdCAN_ULC_S_102_2_2018)
[than 450 and complies with the requirements of Section 720.6.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec720.6)


**720.5 Roof insulation.**


[The use of combustible roof insulation not complying with Sections 720.2 and 720.3 shall be permitted in any type of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec720.2)
construction provided that insulation is covered with approved roof coverings directly applied thereto.


**720.6 Cellulosic fiber loose-fill insulation and self-supported spray-applied cellulosic insulation.**


Cellulosic fiber loose-fill insulation and self-supported spray-applied cellulosic insulation shall comply with CPSC 16 CFR
Parts 1209 [and 1404. Each package of such insulating material shall be clearly labeled in accordance with CPSC 16 CFR](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromCPSC_RefStd16_CFR_Part_1404_2002)
[Parts 1209 and 1404.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromCPSC_RefStd16_CFR_Part_1404_2002)
