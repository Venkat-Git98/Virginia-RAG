# Item 2 of Section 1607.12.2.

**1607.2 Loads not specified.**


[For occupancies or uses not designated in Section 1607, the live load shall be determined in accordance with a method](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1607)
_approved by the building official._

**1607.3 Uniform live loads.**

The live loads used in the design of buildings and other structures shall be the maximum loads expected by the intended
[use or occupancy but shall not be less than the minimum uniformly distributed live loads given in Table 1607.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1607.1_Tbl1607.1)

**1607.4 Concentrated live loads.**

Floors, roofs and other similar surfaces shall be designed to support the uniformly distributed live loads prescribed in
[Section 1607.3 or the concentrated live loads, given in Table 1607.1, whichever produces the greater load effects. Unless](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1607.3)
otherwise specified, the indicated concentration shall be assumed to be uniformly distributed over an area of 2 / feet by1 2
2 / feet (762 mm by 762 mm) and shall be located so as to produce the maximum 1 2 _load effects in the structural_
members.


**1607.5 Partition loads.**


In office buildings and in other buildings where partition locations are subject to change, provisions for partition weight
shall be made, whether or not partitions are shown on the construction documents, unless the specified live load is 80 psf
(3.83 kN/m ) or greater. The partition 2 _load shall be not less than a uniformly distributed live load of 15 psf (0.72 kN/m ).2_


**1607.6 Helipads.**

Helipads shall be designed for the following live loads:

1. A uniform live load, L, as specified in Items 1.1 and 1.2. This load shall not be reduced.

(13.35 kN) or less.

1.2. 60 psf (2.87 kN/m ) where the design basis helicopter has a maximum take-off weight greater than 3,0002


pounds (13.35 kN).

2. A single concentrated live load, L, of 3,000 pounds (13.35 kN) applied over an area of 4.5 inches by 4.5 inches

(114 mm by 114 mm) and located so as to produce the maximum load effects on the structural elements under
consideration. The concentrated load is not required to act concurrently with other uniform or concentrated live
_loads._

3. Two single concentrated _live loads,_ _L, 8 feet (2438 mm) apart applied on the landing pad (representing the_

helicopter’s two main landing gear, whether skid type or wheeled type), each having a magnitude of 0.75 times the
maximum take-off weight of the helicopter, and located so as to produce the maximum load effects on the structural
elements under consideration. The concentrated loads shall be applied over an area of 8 inches by 8 inches (203
mm by 203 mm) and are not required to act concurrently with other uniform or concentrated live loads.

Landing areas designed for a design basis helicopter with maximum take-off weight of 3,000 pounds (13.35 kN) shall

be identified with a 3,000-pound (13.34 kN) weight limitation. The landing area weight limitation shall be indicated by the
numeral “3” (kips) located in the bottom right corner of the landing area as viewed from the primary approach path. The
indication for the landing area weight limitation shall be a minimum 5 feet (1524 mm) in height.
