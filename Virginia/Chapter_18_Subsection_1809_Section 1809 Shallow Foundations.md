The top surface of footings shall be level. The bottom surface of footings shall be permitted to have a slope not exceeding
1 unit vertical in 10 units horizontal (10-percent slope). Footings shall be stepped where it is necessary to change the
elevation of the top surface of the footing or where the surface of the ground slopes more than 1 unit vertical in 10 units
horizontal (10-percent slope).


**1809.4 Depth and width of footings.**


The minimum depth of footings below the undisturbed ground surface shall be 12 inches (305 mm). Where applicable,
[the requirements of Section 1809.5 shall be satisfied. The minimum width of footings shall be 12 inches (305 mm).](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1809.5)


**1809.5 Frost protection.**


Except where otherwise protected from frost, foundations and other permanent supports of buildings and structures shall
be protected from frost by one or more of the following methods:


1. Extending below the frost line of the locality.

2. [Constructing in accordance with ASCE 32.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd32_01)

than light-frame construction.

3. Eave height of 10 feet (3048 mm) or less.

_Shallow foundations shall not bear on frozen soil unless such frozen condition is of a permanent character._

**1809.5.1 Frost protection at required exits.**

Frost protection shall be provided at exterior landings for all required exits with outward-swinging doors. Frost protection
shall only be required to the extent necessary to ensure the unobstructed opening of the required exit doors.

**1809.6 Location of footings.**

Footings on granular soil shall be so located that the line drawn between the lower edges of adjoining footings shall not
have a slope steeper than 30 degrees (0.52 rad) with the horizontal, unless the material supporting the higher footing is
braced or retained or otherwise laterally supported in an approved manner or a greater slope has been properly
established by engineering analysis.


**1809.7 Prescriptive footings for light-frame construction.**


Where a specific design is not provided, concrete or masonry-unit footings supporting walls of light-frame construction
[shall be permitted to be designed in accordance with Table 1809.7.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1809.7_Tbl1809.7)

# b. The ground under the floor shall be permitted to be excavated to the elevation of
 the top of the footing.

 c. Interior stud-bearing walls shall be permitted to be supported by isolated footings.


# The footing width and length shall be twice the width shown in this table, and footings shall be spaced not more than 6 feet on center.

 d. See Section 1905 for additional requirements for concrete footings of structures
 assigned to Seismic Design Category C, D, E or F.

**1809.8 Plain concrete footings.**

The edge thickness of plain concrete footings supporting walls of other than light-frame construction shall be not less
than 8 inches (203 mm) where placed on soil or rock.


**Exception: For plain concrete footings supporting Group R-3 occupancies, the edge thickness is permitted to be 6**
