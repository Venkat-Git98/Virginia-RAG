 SECTION 2211
 COLD-FORMED STEEL LIGHT-FRAME CONSTRUCTION

**2211.1 Structural framing.**


For cold-formed steel light-frame construction, the design and installation of the following structural framing systems,
[including their members and connections, shall be in accordance with AISI S240, and Sections 2211.1.1 through 2211.1.3,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAISI_RefStdAISI_S240_20)
as applicable:

1. Floor and roof systems.

2. Structural walls.

3. Shear walls, strap-braced walls and diaphragms that resist in-plane lateral loads.

4. Trusses.

**2211.1.1 Seismic requirements for cold-formed steel structural systems.**

The design of cold-formed steel light-frame construction to resist seismic forces shall be in accordance with the provisions
[of Section 2211.1.1.1 or 2211.1.1.2, as applicable.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2211.1.1.1)

**2211.1.1.1 Seismic Design Categories B and C.**

[Where a response modification coefficient, R, in accordance with ASCE 7, Table 12.2-1 is used for the design of cold-](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
formed steel light-frame construction assigned to Seismic Design Category B or C, the seismic force-resisting system shall
[be designed and detailed in accordance with the requirements of AISI S400.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAISI_RefStdAISI_S400_20)

**Exception: The response modification coefficient, R, designated for “Steel systems not specifically detailed for**
[seismic resistance, excluding cantilever column systems” in ASCE 7, Table 12.2-1, shall be permitted for systems](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
[designed and detailed in accordance with AISI S240 and need not be designed and detailed in accordance with AISI](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAISI_RefStdAISI_S240_20)
S400


**2211.1.1.2 Seismic Design Categories D through F.**


In cold-formed steel light-frame construction assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E or F, the seismic force-resisting
_[system shall be designed and detailed in accordance with AISI S400.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAISI_RefStdAISI_S400_20)_


**2211.1.2 Prescriptive framing.**


Detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses, less than or equal to three stories above grade plane, shall be
[permitted to be constructed in accordance with AISI S230 subject to the limitations therein.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAISI_RefStdAISI_S230_2019)


**2211.1.3 Truss design.**

[Cold-formed steel trusses shall comply with the additional provisions of Sections 2211.1.3.1. through 2211.1.3.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch22_Sec2211.1.3.1)

**2211.1.3.1 Truss design drawings.**


[The truss design drawings shall conform to the requirements of Section I1 of AISI S202 and shall be provided with the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAISI_RefStdAISI_S202_20)
shipment of trusses delivered to the job site. The truss design drawings shall include the details of permanent individual
_[truss member restraint/bracing in accordance with Section I1.6 of AISI S202 where these methods are utilized to provide](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAISI_RefStdAISI_S202_20)_
restraint/bracing.


**2211.1.3.2 Trusses spanning 60 feet or greater.**


The owner or the owner’s authorized agent shall contract with a registered design professional for the design of the
temporary installation restraint/bracing and the permanent individual truss member restraint/bracing for trusses with
clear spans 60 feet (18 288 mm) or greater. Special inspection of trusses over 60 feet (18 288 mm) in length shall be in
[accordance with Section 1705.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1705.2)


**2211.1.3.3 Truss quality assurance.**


Trusses not part of a manufacturing process that provides requirements for quality control done under the supervision of
[a third-party quality control agency in accordance with AISI S240 Chapter D shall be fabricated in compliance with](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAISI_RefStdAISI_S240_20)
[Sections 1704.2.5 and 1705.2, as applicable.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1704.2.5)

**2211.2 Nonstructural members.**

For cold-formed steel light-frame construction, the design and installation of nonstructural members and connections
[shall be in accordance with AISI S220.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAISI_RefStdAISI_S220_20)
