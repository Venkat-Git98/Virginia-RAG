4. Wood structural use panels / inch (6.4 mm) or /1 4 5 16 inch (23.8 mm) in thickness shall have studs spaced not


more than 2 feet (610 mm) on center.


5. Wood structural use panels / inch (9.5 mm) or / inch (12.7 mm) in thickness shall have studs spaced not more3 8 1 2

than 4 feet (1219 mm) on center provided that a 2-inch by 4-inch (51 mm by 102 mm) stiffener is placed
horizontally at mid-height where the stud spacing is greater than 2 feet (610 mm) on center.


6. Wood structural use panels / inch (15.9 mm) or thicker shall not span over 8 feet (2438 mm).5 8

imposed loads. The design live load shall be not less than 150 psf (7.2 kN/m ) for the entire structure.2


**Exception: Roofs and supporting structures of covered walkways for new, light-frame construction not exceeding two**
_stories above grade plane are permitted to be designed for a live load of 75 psf (3.6kN/m ) or the 2_ _loads imposed on_
them, whichever is greater. In lieu of such designs, the roof and supporting structure of a covered walkway are
permitted to be constructed as follows:


1. Footings shall be continuous 2-inch by 6-inch (51 mm by 152 mm) members.


2. Posts not less than 4 inches by 6 inches (102 mm by 152 mm) shall be provided on both sides of the roof and

3. Stringers not less than 4 inches by 12 inches (102 mm by 305 mm) shall be placed on edge upon the posts.


4. Joists resting on the stringers shall be not less than 2 inches by 8 inches (51 mm by 203 mm) and shall be

5. The deck shall be planks not less than 2 inches (51 mm) thick or wood structural panels with an exterior


exposure durability classification not less than 23 32/ inch (18.3 mm) thick nailed to the joists.


6. Each post shall be knee braced to joists and stringers by members not less than 2 inches by 4 inches (51 mm

by 102 mm); 4 feet (1219 mm) in length.

7. A curb that is not less than 2 inches by 4 inches (51 mm by 102 mm) shall be set on edge along the outside

**[BS] 3306.8 Repair, maintenance and removal.**

Pedestrian protection required by this chapter shall be maintained in place and kept in good order for the entire length of
time pedestrians are subject to being endangered. The owner or the owner’s authorized agent, on completion of the

**[BS] 3306.9 Adjacent to excavations.**

Every excavation on a site located 5 feet (1524 mm) or less from the street lot line shall be enclosed with a barrier not
less than 6 feet (1829 mm) in height. Where located more than 5 feet (1524 mm) from the street lot line, a barrier shall
be erected where required by the building official. Barriers shall be of adequate strength to resist wind pressure as
