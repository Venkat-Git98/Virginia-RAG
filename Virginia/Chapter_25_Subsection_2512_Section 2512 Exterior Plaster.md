[by another wall, plaster application need only be two coats, provided that the total thickness is as set forth in ASTM C926.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdC926_2018B)


**2512.1.1 On-grade floor slab.**


On wood frame or steel stud construction with an on-grade concrete floor slab system, exterior plaster shall be applied in
such a manner as to cover, but not to extend below, the lath and paper. The application of lath, paper and flashing or
[drip screeds shall comply with ASTM C1063.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdC1063_2018B)


**2512.1.2 Weep screeds.**


A minimum 0.019-inch (0.48 mm) (No. 26 galvanized sheet gage), corrosion-resistant weep screed with a minimum
vertical attachment flange of 3 / inches (89 mm) shall be provided at or below the foundation plate line on exterior stud1 2
[walls in accordance with ASTM C926. The weep screed shall be placed not less than 4 inches (102 mm) above the earth or](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdC926_2018B)
2 inches (51 mm) above paved areas and be of a type that will allow trapped water to drain to the exterior of the
building. The water-resistive barrier shall lap the attachment flange. The exterior lath shall cover and terminate on the
attachment flange of the weep screed.


**2512.2 Plasticity agents.**


Only approved plasticity agents and approved amounts thereof shall be added to Portland cement or blended cements.
Where plastic cement or masonry cement is used, additional lime or plasticizers shall not be added. Hydrated lime or the
equivalent amount of lime putty used as a plasticizer is permitted to be added to cement plaster or cement and lime
[plaster in an amount not to exceed that set forth in ASTM C926.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdC926_2018B)


**2512.3 Limitations.**

_Gypsum plaster shall not be used on exterior surfaces._

**2512.4 Cement plaster.**


Plaster coats shall be protected from freezing for a period of not less than 24 hours after set has occurred. Plaster shall be
applied when the ambient temperature is higher than 40°F (4°C), unless provisions are made to keep cement plaster
work above 40°F (4°C) during application and 48 hours thereafter.


**2512.5 Second-coat application.**


The second coat shall be brought out to proper thickness, rodded and floated sufficiently rough to provide adequate bond
for the finish coat. The second coat shall not have variations greater than / inch (6.4 mm) in any direction under a 5-foot1 4
(1524 mm) straight edge.


**2512.6 Curing and interval.**

[First and second coats of cement plaster shall be applied and moist cured as set forth in ASTM C926 and Table 2512.6.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdC926_2018B)

# a. The first two coats shall be as required for the first coats of exterior plaster,
 except that the moist-curing time period between the first and second coats shall be not less than 24 hours. Moist curing shall not be required where job and weather conditions are favorable to the retention of moisture in the cement plaster for the required time period.
