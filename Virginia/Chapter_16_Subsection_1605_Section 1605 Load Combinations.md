# CHAPTER 16 STRUCTURAL DESIGN

 SECTION 1605
 LOAD COMBINATIONS


**1605.1 General.**


Buildings and other structures and portions thereof shall be designed to resist the strength load combinations specified in
[ASCE 7, Section 2.3, the allowable stress design load combinations specified in ASCE 7, Section 2.4, or the alternative](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
_[allowable stress design load combinations of Section 1605.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1605.2)_


**Exceptions:**


1 . [The modifications to load combinations of ASCE 7, Section 2.3, ASCE 7, Section 2.4, and Section 1605.2](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

[specified in ASCE 7, Chapters 18 and 19 shall apply.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

2. [Where the allowable stress design load combinations of ASCE 7 Section 2.4 are used, flat roof snow loads of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

30 pounds per square foot (1.44 kN/m ) and 2 _roof live loads of 30 pounds per square foot (1.44 kN/m ) or less2_
need not be combined with seismic load. Where flat roof snow loads exceed 30 pounds per square foot (1.44
kN/m ), 20 percent shall be combined with seismic loads.2

3. [Where the allowable stress design load combinations of ASCE 7 Section 2.4 are used, crane hook loads need](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

not be combined with roof live loads or with more than three-fourths of the snow load or one-half of the wind
loads.

4. Where design for tornado loads is required, the alternative allowable stress design load combinations of

[Section 1605.2 shall not apply when tornado loads govern the design.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1605.2)

**1605.1.1 Stability.**

Regardless of which load combinations are used to design for strength, where overall structure stability (such as stability
against overturning, sliding, or buoyancy) is being verified, use of the load combinations specified in Section 2.3 or 2.4
[of ASCE 7, and in Section 1605.2 shall be permitted. Where the load combinations specified in ASCE 7, Section 2.3 are](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
used, strength reduction factors applicable to soil resistance shall be provided by a registered design professional. The
[stability of retaining walls shall be verified in accordance with Section 1807.2.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1807.2.3)


**1605.2 Alternative allowable stress design load combinations.**


[In lieu of the load combinations in ASCE 7, Section 2.4, structures and portions thereof shall be permitted to be designed](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
for the most critical effects resulting from the following combinations. Where using these alternative allowable stress load
combinations that include wind or seismic loads, allowable stresses are permitted to be increased or load combinations
reduced where permitted by the material chapter of this code or the referenced standards. For load combinations that
include the counteracting effects of dead and wind loads, only two-thirds of the minimum dead load likely to be in place
during a design wind event shall be used. Where using these alternative load combinations to evaluate sliding,
overturning and soil bearing at the soilstructure interface, the reduction of foundation overturning from Section 12.13.4 in
[ASCE 7 shall not be used. Where using these alternative basic load combinations for proportioning foundations for](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
loadings, which include seismic loads, the vertical seismic load effect, E, in Equation 12.4-4 of v [ASCE 7 is permitted to be](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
[taken equal to zero. Where required by ASCE 7, Chapters 12, 13 and 15, the load combinations including overstrength of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
[ASCE 7, Section 2.4.6 shall be used.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

**Exceptions:** **(Equation 16-6)**


1. Crane hook loads need not be combined with roof live loads or with more than three-fourths of the snow load

or one-half of the wind load.

2. Flat roof snow loads of 30 pounds per square foot (1.44 kN/m ) or less and 2 _roof live loads of 30 pounds per_

square foot (1.44 kN/m ) or less need not be combined with seismic loads. Where flat roof snow loads exceed 302
pounds per square foot (1.44 kN/m ), 20 percent shall be combined with seismic loads.2
