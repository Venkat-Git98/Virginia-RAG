# CHAPTER 26 PLASTIC

 SECTION 2613
 FIBER-REINFORCED POLYMER


**2613.1 General.**


The provisions of this section shall govern the requirements and uses of fiber-reinforced polymer in and on buildings and
structures.

**2613.2 Labeling and identification.**

Packages and containers of fiber-reinforced polymer and their components delivered to the job site shall bear the label of
an approved agency showing the manufacturer’s name, product listing, product identification and information sufficient
to determine that the end use will comply with the code requirements.

**2613.3 Interior finishes.**

_Fiber-reinforced polymer used as interior finishes, decorative materials_ _or_ _[trim shall comply with Chapter 8.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch08)_

**2613.3.1 Foam plastic cores.**

_[Fiber-reinforced polymer used as interior finish and that contains foam plastic cores shall comply with Chapter 8 and this](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch08)_
chapter.

**2613.4 Light-transmitting materials.**

_[Fiber-reinforced polymer used as light-transmitting materials shall comply with Sections 2606 through 2611 as required](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2606)_
for the specific application.

**2613.5 Exterior use.**

_Fiber-reinforced polymer shall be permitted to be installed on the exterior walls of buildings of any type of construction_
[where such polymers meet the requirements of Section 2603.5. Fireblocking shall be installed in accordance with Section](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2603.5)
718.

**Exceptions:**

1. [Compliance with Section 2603.5 is not required where all of the following conditions are met:](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2603.5)

1.1. The fiber-reinforced polymer shall not exceed an aggregate total of 20 percent of the area of the specific

wall to which it is attached, and single architectural elements shall not exceed 10 percent of the area of the
specific wall to which it is attached, and no contiguous sets of architectural elements shall not exceed 10
percent of the area of the specific wall to which they are attached.

1.2. The fiber-reinforced polymer shall have a flame spread index of 25 or less. The flame spread index


requirement shall not be required for coatings or paints having a thickness of less than 0.036 inch (0.9 mm)
that are applied directly to the surface of the fiber-reinforced polymer.

1.3. _[Fireblocking complying with Section 718.2.6 shall be installed.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec718.2.6)_

1.4. The fiber-reinforced polymer shall be installed directly to a noncombustible substrate or be separated

from the exterior wall by one of the following materials: corrosion-resistant steel having a minimum base
metal thickness of 0.016 inch (0.41 mm) at any point, aluminum having a minimum thickness of 0.019 inch
(0.5 mm) or other approved noncombustible material.

2. [Compliance with Section 2603.5 is not required where the fiber-reinforced polymer is installed on buildings](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2603.5)

that are 40 feet (12 190 mm) or less above grade and the following conditions are met:

2.1. [The fiber-reinforced polymer shall meet the requirements of Section 1405.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch14_Sec1405.1)

2.2. Where the fire separation distance is 5 feet (1524 mm) or less, the area of the fiber-reinforced polymer

shall not exceed 10 percent of the wall area. Where the fire separation distance is greater than 5 feet (1524
mm), the area of the exterior wall coverage using fiber-reinforced polymer shall not be limited.

2.3. The fiber-reinforced polymer shall have a flame spread index of 200 or less. The flame spread index

requirements do not apply to coatings or paints having a thickness of less than 0.036 inch (0.9 mm) that are
applied directly to the surface of the fiber-reinforced polymer.


2.4. _[Fireblocking complying with Section 718.2.6 shall be installed.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch07_Sec718.2.6)_
