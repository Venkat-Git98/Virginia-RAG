4. The structure is anchored to withstand wind loads as required by this code.

5. The structure shall be of light-frame construction with walls and roof of light weight material, not slate, tile,

brick or masonry.

**1808.2 Design for capacity and settlement.**

Foundations shall be so designed that the allowable bearing capacity of the soil is not exceeded, and that differential
settlement is minimized. Foundations in areas with expansive soils shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of
[Section 1808.6.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1808.6)


**1808.3 Design loads.**


Foundations shall be designed for the most unfavorable effects due to the combinations of loads specified in Section 2.3
[or 2.4 of ASCE 7 or the alternative allowable stress design load combinations of Section 1605.2. The dead load is](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

[1607.14, shall be permitted to be used in the design of foundations.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1607.14)


**1808.3.1 Seismic overturning.**


Where foundations are proportioned using the load combinations of Section 2.3 or 2.4 of [ASCE 7 and the computation of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)

where the grade is not increased more than 1 foot (305 mm) from original design grade or where approved by the
_building official._

**1808.4 Vibratory loads.**

Where machinery operations or other vibrations are transmitted through the foundation, consideration shall be given in
the foundation design to prevent detrimental disturbances of the soil.

**1808.5 Shifting or moving soils.**

Where it is known that the shallow subsoils are of a shifting or moving character, foundations shall be carried to a
sufficient depth to ensure stability.

[not contain expansive soils and shall comply with Section 1804.5 or 1804.6.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1804.5)

**Exception: Expansive soil need not be removed to the depth of constant moisture, provided that the confining**
pressure in the expansive soil created by the fill and supported structure exceeds the swell pressure.


**1808.6.4 Stabilization.**


[Where the active zone of expansive soils is stabilized in lieu of designing foundations in accordance with Section 1808.6.1](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1808.6.1)

**1808.7 Foundations on or adjacent to slopes.**

The placement of buildings and structures on or adjacent to slopes steeper than one unit vertical in three units horizontal
[(33.3-percent slope) shall comply with Sections 1808.7.1 through 1808.7.5.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1808.7.1)

**1808.7.1 Building clearance from ascending slopes.**

In general, buildings below slopes shall be set a sufficient distance from the slope to provide protection from slope
[drainage, erosion and shallow failures. Except as provided in Section 1808.7.5 and Figure 1808.7.1, the following criteria](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1808.7.5)
will be assumed to provide this protection. Where the existing slope is steeper than one unit vertical in one unit
horizontal (100-percent slope), the toe of the slope shall be assumed to be at the intersection of a horizontal plane drawn
from the top of the foundation and a plane drawn tangent to the slope at an angle of 45 degrees (0.79 rad) to the
horizontal. Where a retaining wall is constructed at the toe of the slope, the height of the slope shall be measured from
the top of the wall to the top of the slope.


For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm.

**1808.7.2 Foundation setback from descending slope surface.**


Foundations on or adjacent to slope surfaces shall be founded in firm material with an embedment and set back from the
slope surface sufficient to provide vertical and lateral support for the foundation without detrimental settlement. Except
[as provided for in Section 1808.7.5 and Figure 1808.7.1, the following setback is deemed adequate to meet the criteria.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch18_Sec1808.7.5)
