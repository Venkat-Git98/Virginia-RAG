[cohesive/adhesive bond strength shall be determined in accordance with the field test specified in ASTM E736 by testing](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE736_E736M_2017)
[in-place samples of the sprayed fire-resistant material selected in accordance with Sections 1705.15.6.1 through](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1705.15.6.1)
[1705.15.6.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1705.15.6.3)



**[BF] 1705.15.6.1 Floor, roof and wall assemblies.**


The test samples for determining the cohesive/adhesive bond strength of the sprayed fire-resistant materials shall be
selected from each floor, roof and wall assembly at the rate of not less than one sample for every 2,500 square feet (232
m ) of the sprayed area, or portion thereof, in each 2 _story._

**[BF] 1705.15.6.2 Structural members.**

The test samples for determining the cohesive/adhesive bond strength of the sprayed fire-resistant materials shall be
selected from beams, girders, trusses, columns and other structural members at the rate of not less than one sample for
each type of structural member for each 2,500 square feet (232 m ) of floor area or portion thereof in each 2 _story._



**[BF] 1705.15.6.3 Primer, paint and encapsulant bond tests.**


Bond tests to qualify a primer, paint or encapsulant shall be conducted where the sprayed fire-resistant material is
applied to a primed, painted or encapsulated surface for which acceptable bond-strength performance between these
coatings and the fire-resistant material has not been determined. A bonding agent approved by the SFRM manufacturer
shall be applied to a primed, painted or encapsulated surface where the bond strengths are found to be less than
required values.



**[BF] 1705.16 Mastic and intumescent fire-resistant coatings.**


_Special inspections and tests for mastic and intumescent fire-resistant coatings applied to structural elements and decks_
[shall be performed in accordance with AWCI 12-B.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAWCI_RefStd12_B_14) _Special inspections and tests shall be based on the fire-resistance_
design as designated in the approved construction documents. Special inspections and tests shall be performed during
construction. Additional visual inspection shall be performed after the rough installation and, where applicable, prior to
the concealment of electrical, automatic sprinkler, mechanical and plumbing systems.

**1705.17 Exterior insulation and finish systems (EIFS).**

_Special inspections shall be required for all EIFS applications._

**Exceptions:**

1. _Special inspections shall not be required for EIFS applications installed over a water-resistive barrier with a_

means of draining moisture to the exterior.

2. _Special inspections shall not be required for EIFS applications installed over masonry or concrete walls._

**1705.17.1 Water-resistive barrier coating.**

A _[water-resistive barrier coating complying with ASTM E2570 requires special inspection of the water-resistive barrier](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASTM_RefStdE2570_E2570M_07_2014_E1)_
coating where installed over a sheathing substrate.

**[F] 1705.19 Testing for smoke control.**

Smoke control systems shall be tested by a special inspector.

**[F] 1705.19.1 Testing scope.**

The test scope shall be as follows:

1. During erection of ductwork and prior to concealment for the purposes of leakage testing and recording of device

location.

2. Prior to occupancy and after sufficient completion for the purposes of pressure difference testing, flow

measurements and detection and control verification.

**[F] 1705.19.2 Qualifications.**

_Approved agencies for smoke control testing shall have expertise in fire protection engineering, mechanical engineering_
and certification as air balancers.

**1705.20 Sealing of mass timber.**

Periodic special inspections of sealants or adhesives shall be conducted where sealant or adhesive required by Section
703.7 is applied to mass timber building elements as designated in the approved construction documents.
