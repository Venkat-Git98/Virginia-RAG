# CHAPTER 17 SPECIAL INSPECTIONS AND TESTS

 SECTION 1709
 PRECONSTRUCTION LOAD TESTS


**1709.1 General.**


Where proposed construction is not capable of being designed by approved engineering analysis, or where proposed
construction design method does not comply with the applicable material design standard, the system of construction or
[the structural unit and the connections shall be subjected to the tests prescribed in Section 1709. The building official](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1709)
shall accept certified reports of such tests conducted by an approved testing agency, provided that such tests meet the
requirements of this code and approved procedures.

**1709.2 Load test procedures specified.**

Where specific load test procedures, load factors and acceptance criteria are included in the applicable referenced
standards, such test procedures, load factors and acceptance criteria shall apply. In the absence of specific test
[procedures, load factors or acceptance criteria, the corresponding provisions in Section 1709.3 shall apply.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1709.3)

**1709.3 Load test procedures not specified.**

Where load test procedures are not specified in the applicable referenced standards, the load-bearing and deformation
capacity of structural components and assemblies shall be determined on the basis of a test procedure developed by a
_registered design professional that simulates applicable loading and deformation conditions. For components and_
[assemblies that are not a part of the seismic force-resisting system, the test shall be as specified in Section 1709.3.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1709.3.1)
[Load tests shall simulate the applicable loading conditions specified in Chapter 16.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16)


**1709.3.1 Test procedure.**


The test assembly shall be subjected to an increasing superimposed load equal to not less than two times the
superimposed design load. The test load shall be left in place for a period of 24 hours. The tested assembly shall be
considered to have successfully met the test requirements if the assembly recovers not less than 75 percent of the
maximum deflection within 24 hours after the removal of the test load. The test assembly shall then be reloaded and
subjected to an increasing superimposed load until either structural failure occurs or the superimposed load is equal to
[two and one-half times the load at which the deflection limitations specified in Section 1709.3.2 were reached, or the load](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1709.3.2)
is equal to two and one-half times the superimposed design load. In the case of structural components and assemblies for
[which deflection limitations are not specified in Section 1709.3.2, the test specimen shall be subjected to an increasing](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1709.3.2)
superimposed load until structural failure occurs or the load is equal to two and one-half times the desired superimposed
design load. The allowable superimposed design load shall be taken as the least of:


1. [The load at the deflection limitation given in Section 1709.3.2.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1709.3.2)

2. The failure load divided by 2.5.

3. The maximum load applied divided by 2.5.

**1709.3.2 Deflection.**

[The deflection of structural members under the design load shall not exceed the limitations in Section 1604.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1604.3)

**1709.4 Wall and partition assemblies.**


_Load-bearing wall and partition assemblies shall sustain the test load both with and without window framing. The test load_
shall include all design load components. Wall and partition assemblies shall be tested both with and without door and
window framing.


**1709.5 Exterior window and door assemblies.**


The design pressure rating of exterior windows and doors in buildings shall be determined in accordance with Section
[1709.5.1 or 1709.5.2. For exterior windows and doors tested in accordance with Section 1709.5.1 or 1709.5.2, required](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1709.5.2)
[design wind pressures determined from ASCE 7 shall be permitted to be converted to allowable stress design by](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)
multiplying by 0.6.

**Exception: Structural wind load design pressures for window or door assemblies other than the size tested in**
[accordance with Section 1709.5.1 or 1709.5.2 shall be permitted to be different than the design value of the tested](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch17_Sec1709.5.1)
assembly, provided that such pressures are determined by accepted engineering analysis or validated by an
additional test of the window or door assembly to the alternative allowable design pressure in accordance with Section
1709.5.2. Components of the alternate size assembly shall be the same as the tested or labeled assembly. Where
[engineering analysis is used, it shall be performed in accordance with the analysis procedures of AAMA 2502.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAAMA_RefStd2502_19)

**1709.5.1 Exterior windows and doors.**

[Exterior windows and sliding doors shall be tested and labeled as conforming to AAMA/WDMA/CSA101/I.S.2/A440. The](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromAAMA_RefStdAAMA_WDMA_CSA_101_I_S_2_A440_17)
