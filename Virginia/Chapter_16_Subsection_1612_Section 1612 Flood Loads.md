# CHAPTER 16 STRUCTURAL DESIGN

 SECTION 1612
 FLOOD LOADS


**1612.1 General.**


[Within flood hazard areas as established in Section 1612.3, all new construction of buildings, structures and portions of](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1612.3)
buildings and structures, including substantial improvement and restoration of substantial damage to buildings and
structures, shall be designed and constructed to resist the effects of flood hazards and flood loads. For buildings that are
located in more than one flood hazard area, the provisions associated with the most restrictive flood hazard area shall
apply.


**1612.1.1** **Elevation of manufactured homes.**


New or replacement manufactured homes to be located in any flood hazard zone shall be placed in accordance with the
applicable elevation requirements of this code.

**Exception: Manufactured homes installed on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision shall be**
permitted to be placed so that the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation
elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches (914 mm) above grade in lieu of being
elevated at or above the base flood elevation provided no manufactured home at the same site has sustained flood
damage exceeding 50 percent of the market value of the home before the damage occurred.


**1612.2 Design and construction.**


The design and construction of buildings and structures located in flood hazard areas, including coastal high hazard areas
[and coastal A zones, shall be in accordance with Chapter 5 of ASCE 7 and ASCE 24.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd7_16_with_Supplement_1)


**1612.3 Establishment of flood hazard areas.**


To establish _flood hazard areas, the applicable governing authority shall adopt a flood hazard map and supporting data._
The flood hazard map shall include, at a minimum, areas of special flood hazard as identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in an engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for [INSERT NAME OF JURISDICTION],”
dated [INSERT DATE OF ISSUANCE], as amended or revised with the accompanying _Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and_
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) and related supporting data along with any revisions thereto. The adopted
flood hazard map and supporting data are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this section.

**1612.3.1 Design flood elevations.**

[Where design flood elevations are not included in the flood hazard areas established in Section 1612.3, or where](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16_Sec1612.3)
_floodways are not designated, the building official is authorized to require the applicant to do one of the following:_

1. Obtain and reasonably utilize any design flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or

other source.

2. Determine the design flood elevation or floodway in accordance with accepted hydrologic and hydraulic

engineering practices used to define special flood hazard areas. Determinations shall be undertaken by a registered
_design professional who shall document that the technical methods used reflect currently accepted engineering_
practice.


**1612.3.2 Determination of impacts.**

In riverine flood hazard areas where design flood elevations are specified but floodways have not been designated, the
applicant shall provide a floodway analysis that demonstrates that the proposed work will not increase the design flood
_elevation more than 1 foot (305 mm) at any point within the jurisdiction of the applicable governing authority._

**1612.4 Flood hazard documentation.**

The following documentation shall be prepared and sealed by a registered design professional and submitted to the
_building official:_


1. For construction in flood hazard areas other than coastal high hazard areas or coastal A zones:


1.1. The elevation of the lowest floor, including the basement, as required by the lowest floor elevation inspection


[in Section 113.3.2 and for the final inspection in Section 113.3.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01_Sec113.3.2)


1.2. For fully enclosed areas below the design flood elevation where provisions to allow for the automatic entry

[and exit of floodwaters do not meet the minimum requirements in Section 2.7.2.1 of ASCE 24,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd24_14) _construction_
_documents shall include a statement that the design will provide for equalization of hydrostatic flood forces in_
[accordance with Section 2.7.2.2 of ASCE 24.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd24_14)

1.3. For dry floodproofed nonresidential buildings, construction documents shall include a statement that the dry

_[floodproofing is designed in accordance with ASCE 24](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd24_14)_ and shall include the flood emergency plan specified in

2.1. The elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member as required by the lowest floor


[elevation inspection in Section 113.3.2 and for the final inspection in Section 113.3.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch01_Sec113.3.2)


2.2. _[Construction documents shall include a statement that the building is designed in accordance with ASCE 24,](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch35_PromASCE_SEI_RefStd24_14)_

including that the pile or column foundation and building or structure to be attached thereto is designed to be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and flood loads acting
[simultaneously on all building components, and other load requirements of Chapter 16.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16)

2.3. For breakaway walls designed to have a resistance of more than 20 psf (0.96 kN/m) determined using2
