For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm.

a. Roof supports: Fire-resistance ratings of primary structural frame and bearing

walls are permitted to be reduced by 1 hour where supporting a roof only.

b. Except in Group F-1, H, M and S-1 occupancies, fire protection of structural

members in roof construction shall not be required, including protection of primary
structural frame members, roof framing and decking where every part of the roof
construction is 20 feet or more above any floor immediately below. Fire-retardanttreated wood members shall be allowed to be used for such unprotected members.

c. [In all occupancies, heavy timber complying with Section 2304.11 shall be allowed](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch23_Sec2304.11)

for roof construction, including primary structural frame members, where a 1-hour or
less fire-resistance rating is required.

g. Heavy timber bearing walls supporting more than two floors or more than a floor


and a roof shall have a fire resistance rating of not less than 1 hour.

**601.1 Scope.**

The provisions of this chapter shall control the classification of buildings as to type of construction.
