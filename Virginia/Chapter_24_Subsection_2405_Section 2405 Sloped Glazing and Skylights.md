# CHAPTER 24 GLASS AND GLAZING

 SECTION 2405
 SLOPED GLAZING AND SKYLIGHTS


**2405.1 Scope.**


This section applies to the installation of glass and other transparent, translucent or opaque glazing material installed at
a slope of more than 15 degrees (0.26 rad) from the vertical plane, including glazing materials in skylights, roofs and
sloped walls.


**2405.2 Allowable glazing materials and limitations.**

Sloped glazing shall be any of the following materials, subject to the listed limitations.


1. For monolithic glazing systems, the glazing material of the single light or layer shall be laminated glass with a

minimum 30-mil (0.76 mm) polyvinyl butyral (or equivalent) interlayer, wired glass, light-transmitting plastic
[materials meeting the requirements of Section 2607, heat-strengthened glass or fully tempered glass.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2607)

2. For multiple-layer glazing systems, each light or layer shall consist of any of the glazing materials specified in


Item 1.

[Annealed glass is permitted to be used as specified in Exceptions 2 and 3 of Section 2405.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch24_Sec2405.3)

Laminated glass and plastic materials described in Items 1 and 2 shall not require the screening or height restrictions

[provided in Section 2405.3.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch24_Sec2405.3)

[For additional requirements for plastic skylights, see Section 2610. Glass-block construction shall conform to the](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch26_Sec2610)


[requirements of Section 2110.1.](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch21_Sec2110.1)

**2405.3 Screening.**

Where used in monolithic glazing systems, annealed, heat-strengthened, fully tempered and wired glass shall

have broken glass retention screens installed below the glazing material. The screens and their fastenings shall be:
capable of supporting twice the weight of the glazing; firmly and substantially fastened to the framing members; and
installed within 4 inches (102 mm) of the glass. The screens shall be constructed of a noncombustible material not
thinner than No. 12 B&S gage (0.0808 inch) with mesh not larger than 1 inch by 1 inch (25 mm by 25 mm). In a corrosive
atmosphere, structurally equivalent noncorrosive screen materials shall be used. Annealed, heat-strengthened, fully
tempered and wired glass, where used in multiple-layer glazing systems as the bottom glass layer over the walking
surface, shall be equipped with screening that conforms to the requirements for monolithic glazing systems.

**Exception: In monolithic and multiple-layer sloped glazing systems, the following applies:**

1. Fully tempered glass installed without protective screens where glazed between intervening floors at a slope

of 30 degrees (0.52 rad) or less from the vertical plane shall have the highest point of the glass 10 feet (3048
mm) or less above the walking surface.


2. Screens are not required below any glazing material, including annealed glass, where the walking surface

below the glazing material is permanently protected from the risk of falling glass or the area below the glazing
material is not a walking surface.

3. Any glazing material, including annealed glass, is permitted to be installed without screens in the sloped

glazing systems of commercial or detached noncombustible greenhouses used exclusively for growing plants and
not open to the public, provided that the height of the greenhouse at the ridge does not exceed 30 feet (9144
mm) above grade.

4. Screens shall not be required in individual dwelling units in Groups R-2, R-3 and R-4 where fully tempered

glass is used as single glazing or as both panes in an insulating glass unit, and the following conditions are met:

4.1. Each pane of the glass is 16 square feet (1.5 m ) or less in area.2

4.2. The highest point of the glass is 12 feet (3658 mm) or less above any walking surface or other accessible

area.


4.3. The glass thickness is /3 16 inch (4.8 mm) or less.

5. Screens shall not be required for laminated glass with a 15-mil (0.38 mm) polyvinyl butyral (or equivalent)

interlayer used in individual dwelling units in Groups R-2, R-3 and R-4 within the following limits:

5.1. Each pane of glass is 16 square feet (1.5 m ) or less in area.2

5.2. The highest point of the glass is 12 feet (3658 mm) or less above a walking surface or other accessible

area.

**2405.4 Framing.**

In Types I and II construction, sloped glazing and skylight frames shall be constructed of noncombustible materials. In

[glazing and skylights shall be designed to resist the tributary roof loads in Chapter 16. Skylights set at an angle of less](http://codes.iccsafe.org/#VACC2021P1_Ch16)
than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) from the horizontal plane shall be mounted not less than 4 inches (102 mm) above the plane
of the roof on a curb constructed as required for the frame. Skylights shall not be installed in the plane of the roof where
the roof pitch is less than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) from the horizontal.

**Exception: Installation of a skylight without a curb shall be permitted on roofs with a minimum slope of 14 degrees**
(three units vertical in 12 units horizontal) in Group R-3 occupancies. Unit skylights installed in a roof with a pitch
flatter than 14 degrees (0.25 rad) shall be mounted not less than 4 inches (102 mm) above the plane of the roof on a
curb constructed as required for the frame unless otherwise specified in the manufacturer’s installation instructions.

**2405.5 Unit skylights and tubular daylighting devices.**

_Unit skylights_ and tubular daylighting devices shall be tested and labeled as complying with AAMA/WDMA/CSA
