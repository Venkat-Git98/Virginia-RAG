**505.2.2 Regional materials.** A minimum of 40 percent of
building materials or products used, based on cost, shall be
regionally extracted/harvested/recovered and manufactured
within a radius of 500 miles (800 km) of the project site. If
only a fraction of a product or material is extracted/harvested/recovered and manufactured locally, then only that
percentage (by weight) shall contribute to the regional
value.

**Exception: For building materials or products shipped**
in part by rail or water, the total distance to the project
shall be determined by weighted average, whereby that
portion of the distance shipped by rail or water shall be
multiplied by 0.25 and added to that portion not
shipped by rail or water, provided that the total does not
exceed 500 miles (800 km).
**505.2.3 Biobased products. A minimum of 5 percent of**
building materials used, based on cost, shall be biobased
products. Biobased _products shall:_

1. Comply with the minimum biobased contents of the
USDA’s BioPreferred Program;

2. Contain the “USDA Certified _Biobased Product”_
label; or

3. Be composed of solid wood, engineered wood, bamboo, wool, cotton, cork, agricultural fibers, or other
biobased materials with at least 50 percent biobased
content.

**505.2.3.1 Wood building components. Wood building**
components, including but not limited to structural
framing, sheathing, flooring, subflooring, wood window sash and frames, doors, and architectural millwork, used to comply with this requirement shall
contain not less than 60 percent certified wood content
tracked through a chain of custody process, either by
physical separation or percentage-based approaches, or
wood that qualifies as a _salvaged material. Certified_
wood content shall be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Wood building components from a ven_dor shall be permitted to comply when the annual_
average amount of certified wood products purchased
by the _vendor, for which they have chain of custody_
_verification not older than two years, is 60 percent or_
greater of their total annual wood products purchased.
**505.3 Whole building life cycle assessment. Life cycle**
assessment shall conform to the requirements of ASTM
E2921. The requirements for the execution of a whole building life cycle assessment shall be performed in accordance
with the following:

1. The assessment shall demonstrate that the building
project achieves not less than a 20 percent improvement in environmental performance for global warming
potential and at least two (2) of the following impact
measures, as compared to a reference design of similar
usable floor area, function and configuration that meets
the minimum energy requirements of this code and the
structural requirements of the Building Code. For relocatable buildings, the reference design shall be com

prised of the number of reference buildings equal to the
estimated number of uses of the relocatable building.

1.1. Primary energy use.
1.2. Acidification potential.

1.3. Eutrophication potential.

1.4. Ozone depletion potential.

1.5. Smog potential.

2. The life cycle assessment tool shall be approved by the
_code official._

3. Building operational energy shall be included. For relocatable buildings, an average building operational
energy shall be estimated to reflect potential changes in
location, siting, and configuration by adding or subtracting modules, or function.

4. For relocatable buildings, average transportation
energy, material and waste generation associated with
reuse of relocatable buildings shall be included in the
assessment.
**505.4 Multi-attribute material declaration and certifica-**
**tion. Not less than 25 percent of the total building materials**
used in the project, based on cost, shall comply with Section
505.4.1 or 505.4.2. Where a material complies with both Sections 505.4.1 and 505.4.2, the material value shall be multiplied by two.
**505.4.1 Environmental product declaration. A building**
material with a Type III environmental product declaration
that is verified by a program operator. The environmental
product declaration shall comply with the provisions of
ISO 14025 and ISO 21930 and be externally verified.

**505.4.2 Multi-attribute standard. A material specific**
assessment that is verified by an approved agency shall be
submitted for each product in accordance with the following standards, as applicable. The assessment shall be verified as meeting the minimum performance level specified
in each standard, which focuses on the life-cycle stages
from development to end of life. These stages shall
include material selection, energy and water use during
development, performance, human and environmental
impact, and end of life.

1. NSF/ANSI 140 for carpet.
2. NSF/ANSI 332 for resilient floor coverings.

3. NSF/ANSI 336 for commercial furnishings fabric.

4. NSF/ANSI 342 for wall coverings.

5. NSF/ANSI 347 for single-ply roofing membranes.

6. NSC 373 for natural dimension stone.

7. TCNA ANSI/A138.1 for ceramic tiles, glass tiles,
and tile installation materials.

8. UL 100 for gypsum boards and panels.

9. UL 102 for door leafs.
