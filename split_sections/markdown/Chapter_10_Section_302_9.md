**RECEIVING WATERS. Groundwater, creeks, streams, riv-**
ers, lakes or other water bodies that receive treated or
untreated waste water or stormwater, including water from
combined sewer systems and stormwater drains.

**RECLAIMED WATER. Nonpotable water that has been**
derived from the treatment of waste water by a facility or system licensed or permitted to produce water meeting the jurisdiction’s water requirements for its intended uses. Also
known as “Recycled Water.”

**RECYCLABILITY. Ability of a material or product to be**
captured and separated from a waste stream for conversion,
reprocessing or reuse.

**REFRIGERATOR. Equipment designed to enclose a space**
of mechanically cooled and temperature-controlled air used
to maintain prescribed cold food holding temperatures.

**REGISTERED DESIGN PROFESSIONAL. An individual**
who is registered or licensed to practice their respective
design profession as defined by the statutory requirements of
the professional registration laws of the state or jurisdiction in
which the project is to be constructed.

**REGISTERED DESIGN PROFESSIONAL IN RESPON-**
**SIBLE CHARGE. A registered design professional engaged**
by the owner to review and coordinate certain aspects of the
project, as determined by the building official, for compatibility with the design of the building or structure, including
submittal documents prepared by others, deferred submittal
documents and phased submittal documents.

**RELOCATABLE (RELOCATED) MODULAR BUILD-**
**ING. A partially or completely assembled building using a**
modular construction process and designed to be reused or
repurposed multiple times and transported to different building sites.

**RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDIT (REC). An REC rep-**
resents the property rights to the environmental, social, and
other nonpower qualities of renewable electricity generation.
An REC, and its associated attributes and benefits, is sold
separately from the underlying physical electricity associated
with an onsite renewable energy source. REC’s allow organizations to support renewable energy development and protect
the environment where renewable power products are not
locally available. There are two approaches to verifying REC
ownership and the right to make environmental claims: (1)
REC contracts from a list of approved providers, including an
audit of the chain of custody; and (2) REC tracking systems.

**RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE, ONSITE. Energy**
derived from solar radiation, wind, waves, tides, biogas, biomass, or geothermal energy. The energy system providing
onsite renewable energy is located on or adjacent to the building site, and generate energy for use on the building site or to
send back to the energy supply system.

**REPAIR. The reconstruction or renewal of any part of an**
existing building or building site for the purpose of its maintenance.

**RESIDENTIAL OCCUPANCIES (For Section 302). Resi-**
dential Group R-2, R-3 or R-4 occupancies, and buildings
regulated by the Residential Code.


**RETENTION (STORMWATER). The permanent holding**
of stormwater on a site, preventing the water from leaving the
site as surface drainage and allowing for use of the water on
site, or loss of the water through percolation, evaporation or
absorption by vegetation.

**REUSE. To divert a material, product, component, module,**
or a building from the waste stream in order to use it again.

**ROOF COVERING. The covering applied to the roof deck**
for weather resistance, fire classification or appearance.

**ROOF REPLACEMENT. The process of removing the**
existing roof covering, repairing any damaged substrate and
installing a new roof covering.

**ROOF WASHER. A device or method for removal of sedi-**
ment and debris from collection surface by diverting initial
rainfall from entry into the storage tank. Also referred to as a
First Flush Device.

**SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS (HVAC). A fully descrip-**
tive detailed account of the intended operation of HVAC systems covering the operation of systems in narrative terms,
accounting for all of the equipment that makes up the systems, how the systems are designed to operate, and how they
are to be controlled.

**SITE DISTURBANCE. Site preparation or construction**
which negatively affects the native soils, native vegetation, or
native animal life of the site.

**SKYLIGHTS AND SLOPED GLAZING. Glass or other**
transparent or translucent glazing material installed at a slope
of less than 60 degrees (1.05 rad) from horizontal. Glazing
material in skylights, including unit skylights, tubular daylighting devices, solariums, sunrooms, roofs and sloped
walls, are included in this definition.

**SKYLIGHT, UNIT. A factory-assembled, glazed fenestra-**
tion unit, containing one panel of glazing material that allows
for natural lighting through an opening in the roof assembly
while preserving the weather-resistant barrier of the roof.
**SLEEPING UNIT. A room or space in which people sleep,**
that can also include permanent provisions for living, eating,
and either sanitation or kitchen facilities but not both. Such
rooms and spaces that are also part of a dwelling unit are not
sleeping units.

**SOLAR HEAT GAIN COEFFICIENT (SHGC). The ratio**
of the solar heat gain entering the space through the fenestration assembly to the incident solar radiation. Solar heat gain
includes directly transmitted solar heat and absorbed solar
radiation which is then reradiated, conducted or convected
into the space.

**SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM. Devices such as**
photovoltaic (PV) modules and inverters that are used to
transform solar radiation into energy.

**SOLAR REFLECTANCE. A measure of the ability of a**
surface material to reflect sunlight. It is the fraction of incident sunlight reflected by a surface, expressed on a scale of 0
to 1. Solar reflectance is also referred to as “albedo.”

**SOLAR REFLECTANCE INDEX (SRI). A value that**
incorporates both solar reflectance and thermal emittance in a
single measure to represent a surface’s relative temperature in
