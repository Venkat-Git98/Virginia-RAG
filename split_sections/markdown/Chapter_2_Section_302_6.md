**FLOOD HAZARD AREA. The greater of the following two**
areas:

1. The area within a floodplain subject to a 1-percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year;

2. The area designated as a flood hazard area on a community’s flood hazard map, or otherwise legally designated.
**FLOOD OR FLOODING. A general and temporary condi-**
tion of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land
from:

1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters.

2. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
**FLOODPLAIN. An area of land at risk of being inundated**
with water during high flows. Floodplains are associated with
both water courses, such as rivers and streams, and bodies of
water, such as oceans and lakes.

**FLOOR AREA, GROSS (For Section 302).** _Gross floor_
_area shall have the same meaning ascribed to it in the Zoning_
_Regulations, Title 11 DCMR, and as interpreted by the Zon-_
ing Administrator.

**FLOOR AREA, NET. The actual occupied area not includ-**
ing unoccupied accessory areas such as corridors, stairways,
toilet rooms, mechanical rooms and closets.

**FREEZER. Equipment designed to enclose a space of**
mechanically cooled and temperature-controlled air used to
maintain prescribed frozen food holding temperatures.

**FRYER, DEEP FAT. A unit with a width between 12 and**
18 inches (305 and 457 mm) that cooks food by immersion in
a tank of oil or fat more than 25 pounds (11 kg) and less than
50 pounds (23 kg).

**FRYER, LARGE VAT. A unit with a width greater than 18**
inches (457 mm) that cooks food by immersion in a tank of
oil or fat more than 50 pounds (23 kg).

**GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP). The cumu-**
lative radiative forcing effects of a gas over a 100-year time
horizon resulting from the emission of a unit mass of gas relative to a reference gas. The GWP-weighted emissions of
direct greenhouse gases in the U.S. Inventory are presented in
terms of equivalent emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), using
units of teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalents (TgCO2
Eq.). conversion: Tg=10[9] kg = 10[6] metric tons = 1 million
metric tons.

**GRAYWATER. Untreated waste water that has not come**
into contact with waste water from water closets, urinals,
kitchen sinks, or dishwashers. Graywater includes, but is not
limited to, waste water from bathtubs, showers, lavatories,
clothes washers, and laundry trays.

**GREENFIELD. Land that has not been previously devel-**
oped or has a history of only agricultural use.

**GREENHOUSE GAS. A gas in the atmosphere that absorbs**
and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range.

**GRIDDLE, DOUBLE-SIDED. Equipment used to cook**
food between flat, smooth, or grooved horizontal plates
heated from above and underneath.


**GRIDDLE, SINGLE-SIDED. Equipment used to cook food**
directly on a flat, smooth, or grooved horizontal plate heated
from underneath.

**GROSS FLOOR AREA (For Section 302). See Floor area,**
_gross._

**GROUND SOURCE OR GEOEXCHANGE. Where the**
earth is used as a heat sink in air conditioning or heat pump
island systems. This also applies to systems utilizing subsurface water. Ground source heating and cooling uses the relatively constant temperature of the earth below the frost line.
This steady temperature profile allows the earth to be used as
a heat source in the winter and as a heat sink in the summer.
**HARDSCAPE. Areas of a building site covered by man-**
made materials.

**HIGH-OCCUPANCY VEHICLE. A vehicle which is**
occupied by two or more people, including carpools, vanpools, and buses.

**HISTORIC BUILDINGS. Buildings that are listed in or eli-**
gible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or
designated as historic under an appropriate state or local law.

**ICE MACHINE.**

**Ice machine, ice-making head. A factory-made assembly**
consisting of a condensing unit and ice-making section
operating as an integrated unit, with means for making and
harvesting ice, that combines the ice-making mechanism
and the condensing unit in a single package, but requires a
separate ice storage bin.

**Ice machine, remote-condensing unit. A factory-made**
assembly consisting of a condensing unit and ice-making
section operating as an integrated unit, with means for
making and harvesting ice, where the ice-making mechanism and condenser or condensing unit are in separate sections.
**Ice machine, self-contained unit. A factory-made assem-**
bly consisting of a condensing unit and ice-making section
operating as an integrated unit, with means for making and
harvesting ice and where the ice-making mechanism and
storage compartment are combined into an integral cabinet.

**IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. Paved concrete or asphalt and**
other similar surfaces that readily accommodate the flow of
water with relatively little absorption, as typically used at
exterior horizontal areas including, but not limited to, parking
lots, bikeways, walkways, plazas and fire lanes.

**INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR (ISO). The elec-**
tric system’s operator.

**INFEASIBLE. An alteration of a building, site feature, or**
system that has little likelihood of being accomplished
because existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces or features which are in
full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements for
new construction.

**INFRASTRUCTURE. Facilities within a jurisdiction that**
provide community services and networks for travel and
communication including: transportation services such as, but
not limited to roads, bikeways and pedestrian ways and tran
