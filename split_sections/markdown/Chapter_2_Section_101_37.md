within the scope of the Green Construction Code as set forth
in Section 101.4.9.3 of the Building Code that are either new
construction, Level 2 _alterations,_ Level 3 _alterations, or_
_core-and-shell projects (where less than 60 percent of the_
interior occupiable area is completed with permanent lighting, wall partitions, HVAC equipment, and plumbing systems).

**A101.2 Intent. This appendix shall provide a basis by which**
a jurisdiction can implement measures to increase natural
resource conservation, material resource conservation,
energy conservation, water conservation and environmental
comfort and mitigate impacts of building site development.

**SECTION A102**
**APPLICABILITY AND CONFORMANCE**
**A102.1 General. Project electives shall be applicable to**
building, structures and building sites constructed under the
provisions of this code.

**A102.2 Required number of and selection of project elec-**
**tives. New construction projects shall attain a total of 18 proj-**
ect electives; Level 3 _alterations and core-and-shell projects_
shall attain 13 project electives; first time tenant fit-outs 10,000
square feet (929 m[2]) and larger shall attain 10 project electives;
and Level 2 _alterations 50,000 square feet (4645 m[2]) and_
larger, where 10,000 square feet (929 m[2]) of the space is being
reconfigured, shall attain 10 project electives. For first-time
tenant fit-outs and Level 2 alterations, up to three of the project
electives can come from base building features.

Selected project electives shall be applied as mandatory
requirements, and shall be communicated to the code official
in the manner and form specified by the code official. Electives shall be disallowed if an elective is deemed by the code
official not to meet the substantial intent of the elective.

**SECTION A103**
**DEFINITIONS**
**A103.1 Definitions. The following words and terms shall, for**
the purposes of this appendix, have the meanings shown
herein. Refer to Chapter 2 of this code for general definitions.

**DESIGN LIFE. The intended service life or the period of**
time that a building or its component parts are expected to
meet or exceed the performance requirements.


**GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. Renewable energy generated**
from the interior of the Earth and used to produce energy for
heating buildings or serving building commercial or industrial processes.

**INFILL SITE. Infill sites are one of the following:**

1. A vacant lot, or collection of adjoining lots, located in
an established, developed area that is already served by
existing infrastructure;
2. A previously developed lot or a collection of previously
developed adjoining lots, that is being redeveloped or is
designated for redevelopment.
**PROJECT ELECTIVE. The minimum total number of**
project electives that must be selected and complied with as
indicated in Section A102.2 and Tables A104, A105, A106,
A107 and A108.
**SERVICE LIFE. The period of time after installation during**
which a building or its component parts meets or exceeds the
performance requirements.

**VOCs, TOTAL (TVOCs). Sum of the concentrations of all**
identified and unidentified _volatile organic compounds_
between and including n-hexane through n-hexadecane (i.e.,
C6 - C16) as measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry total ion-current chromatogram method and are quantified by converting the total area of the chromatogram in that
analytical window to toluene equivalents.

**SECTION A104**
**SITE PROJECT ELECTIVES**
**A104.1 [Reserved]**

**A104.2 Wildlife corridor project elective. Site development**
that restores a wildlife corridor, connecting wildlife corridors
on adjacent lots, shall be recognized as a project elective.

**A104.3 Bird collision deterrence. Projects that comply with**
LEED Pilot Credit 55: Bird Collision Deterrence (October
16, 2015), shall be recognized as a project elective. Compliance includes satisfaction of all the requirements in LEED
Pilot Credit 55, including, but not limited to, adoption of
post-construction and façade monitoring plans. Project teams
seeking the bird collision deterrence elective(s) shall submit
their post-construction and façade monitoring plans prior to
the final inspection.

Projects with 40 percent or less glazing, excluding party or
common walls, and with no single façade having more than
75 percent glazing, shall receive one (1) project elective.
