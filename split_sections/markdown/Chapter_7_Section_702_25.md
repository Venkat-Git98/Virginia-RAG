lavatories, dishwashers, washing machines and hot water
hose bibbs in accordance with Section 702.8.1 or Section
702.8.2. For purposes of this section, references to pipe shall
include tubing. For purposes of this section, the source of hot
or tempered water shall be considered to be a water heater,
boiler, circulation loop piping or electrically heat-traced piping.

**702.8.1 Maximum allowable pipe length method. The**
maximum allowable pipe length from the source of hot or
tempered water to the termination of the fixture supply
pipe shall be in accordance with the maximum pipe length
columns in Table 702.8.2. Where the length contains more
than one size of pipe, the largest size shall be used for
determining the maximum allowable length of the pipe in
Table 702.8.2.
**702.8.2 Maximum allowable pipe volume method. The**
water volume in the piping shall be calculated in accordance with Section 702.8.2.1. The maximum volume of
hot or tempered water in the piping to public lavatory faucets, metering or nonmetering, shall be 2 ounces (0.06 L).
For fixtures other than public lavatory faucets, the maximum volume shall be 64 ounces (1.89 L) for hot or tempered water from a water heater or boiler; and 24 ounces
(0.7 L) for hot or tempered water from a circulation loop
pipe or an electrically heat-traced pipe.

**702.8.2.1 Water volume determination. The volume**
shall be the sum of the internal volumes of pipe, fittings, valves, meters and manifolds between the source
of hot water and the termination of the fixture supply
pipe. The volume shall be determined from the liquid
ounces per foot column of Table 702.8.2. The volume
contained within fixture shutoff valves, flexible water
supply connectors to a fixture fitting, or within a fixture
fitting shall not be included in the water volume determination. Where hot or tempered water is supplied by a
circulation loop pipe or an electrically heat-traced pipe,


the volume shall include the portion of the fitting on the
source pipe that supplies water to the fixture.
**702.9 [Reserved]**

**702.10 Water-powered pumps. Water-powered pumps shall**
not be used as the primary means of removing ground water
from sumps. Where used as an emergency backup pump for
the primary pump, the primary pump shall be an electrically
powered pump and the water-powered pump shall be
equipped with an auditory alarm that indicates when the
water-powered pump is operating. The alarm shall have a
minimum sound pressure level rating of 85 dB measured at a
distance of 10 feet (3048 mm). Where water-powered pumps
are used, they shall have a water-efficiency factor of pumping
not less than 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a height of 8 feet
(2438 mm) for every 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water used to operate
the pump, measured at a water pressure of 60 psi (413.7 kPa).
Pumps shall be clearly marked as to the gallons (liters) of
water pumped per gallon (liters) of potable water consumed.

**702.11 [Reserved]**

**702.12 Dipper wells. The water supply to a dipper well shall**
have a shutoff valve and flow control valve. Water flow into a
dipper well shall not exceed 1 gpm (3.78 Lpm) at a supply
pressure of 60 psi (413.7 kPa).

**702.13 Automated vehicle wash facilities. Not less than 50**
percent of the water used for the rinsing phase of the wash
cycle at automated vehicle wash facilities shall be collected
to be reused for the washing phase. Towel and chamois washing machines shall have high-level water cutoffs.

**702.13.1 Nonpotable water use. Except for water recircu-**
lated within the facility, potable and nonpotable water use
for automobile washing shall not exceed 40 gallons (151
L) per vehicle for in-bay automatic washing, and 35 gallons (132.5 L) per vehicle for conveyor and express type
car washing.
**Exception: Bus and large commercial vehicle washing**
facilities.
