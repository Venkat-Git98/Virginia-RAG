## CHAPTER 5

# MATERIAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY


**SECTION 501**
**GENERAL**
**501.1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall govern mat-**
ters related to building material conservation, resource efficiency and environmental performance.

**SECTION 502**
**CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL MANAGEMENT**
**502.1 Construction material management. Construction**
material management shall comply with Sections 502.1.1 and
502.1.2.

**502.1.1 Storage and handling of materials. Materials**
stored and handled onsite during construction phases shall
comply with the applicable manufacturer’s printed instructions. Where manufacturer’s printed instructions are not
available, _approved standards or guidelines shall be fol-_
lowed.

**502.1.2 Construction phase moisture control. Porous or**
fibrous materials and other materials subject to moisture
damage shall be protected from moisture during the construction phase. Material damaged by moisture or that are
visibly colonized by fungi either prior to delivery or
during the construction phase shall be cleaned and dried
or, where damage cannot be corrected by such means,
shall be removed and replaced.

**SECTION 503**
**CONSTRUCTION WASTE MANAGEMENT**
**503.1 Construction material and waste management**
**requirements. Not less than 50 percent of nonhazardous con-**
struction waste shall be diverted from disposal, by recycling
or salvage of construction materials and waste.

The owner, contractor or approved agency shall maintain
receipts and other documentation through the course of construction relating to diversion. The percentage of materials
diverted shall be calculated by weight or volume, but not
both. For the purposes of this section, construction materials
and waste shall include, but are not limited to (1) all materials
delivered to the site and intended for installation prior to the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy, including related
packaging; and (2) construction materials and waste removed
during demolition or razing. Construction and waste materials shall not include land-clearing debris. Land-clearing
debris shall include trees, stumps, rocks, and vegetation and
shall be managed in accordance with Section 406.1.

**503.2 Verification. Prior to issuance of the first certificate of**
certificate of occupancy for occupiable space in a story above
_grade plane, or prior to final inspection, if a new certificate of_
occupancy is not required, the _Department is authorized to_
require the owner, contractor or an approved agency to pro

vide verification of the project’s compliance with Section
503.1. When requested by the _code official, evidence of_
diversion shall be provided, which may include, but is not
limited to, hauling receipts.

**SECTION 504**

**[RESERVED]**

**SECTION 505**
**MATERIAL SELECTION**
**505.1 Material selection and properties. For projects that**
are 25,000 square feet (2323 m[2]) and larger, building materials shall conform to Section 505.2, 505.3 or 505.4.

**Exception: Electrical, mechanical, plumbing, security and**
fire detection, and alarm equipment and controls, automatic fire sprinkler systems, elevators and conveying systems shall not be required to comply.

**505.2 Reduced impact materials. The building project shall**
comply with any two of the following: Section 505.2.1,
505.2.2, or 505.2.3. Calculations shall only include materials
_permanently installed in the project. A value of 45 percent of_
the total construction cost shall be permitted to be used in lieu
of the actual total cost of materials.

**505.2.1 Recycled content and salvaged material con-**
**tent. The sum of the** _recycled content and the_ _salvaged_
_material content shall constitute a minimum of 30 percent,_
based on cost, of the total materials in the building project.

**505.2.1.1 Recycled content. The recycled content of a**
material shall be the _postconsumer recycled content_
plus one-half of the _preconsumer recycled content,_
determined by weight (mass). The recycled fraction of
the material in a product or an assembly shall then be
multiplied by the cost of the product or assembly to
determine its contribution to the requirement.

The annual average industry values, by country of
production, for the _recycled content of steel products_
manufactured in basic oxygen furnaces and electric arc
furnaces shall be permitted to be used as the recycled
_content of the steel. For the purpose of calculating the_
_recycled content contribution of concrete, the constitu-_
ent materials in concrete (e.g., the cementitious materials, aggregates, and water) shall be permitted to be
treated as separate components and calculated separately.
**505.2.1.2 Salvaged material content. The** _salvaged_
_material content shall be determined based on the_
actual cost of the _salvaged material or the cost of a_
comparable alternative component material.
