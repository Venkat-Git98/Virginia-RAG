**702.14 Self-service vehicle wash facilities. Spray wand noz-**
zles used at self-service vehicle wash facilities shall discharge not more than 3 gpm (11.4 Lpm). Faucets for chamois
wringer sinks shall be of the self-closing type.

**702.15 Vehicle washing facilities. Waste water from reverse**
osmosis water treatment systems installed in vehicle washing
facilities shall discharge to the washing phase water holding
tank.

**702.16 Food waste disposers. The water flow into a com-**
mercial food waste disposer in a food establishment shall be
controlled by a load-sensing device such that the water flow
does not exceed 1 gpm (3.78 Lpm) under no-load operating
conditions and 8 gpm (30.2 Lpm) under full-load operating
conditions.

**703.3 [Reserved]**

**703.4 Condensate drainage recovery. For new construction**
and Level 3 alteration projects with individual HVAC equipment that is 20 tons or larger, and where a water reclamation
system is being installed or already in place to collect and
reuse condensate, condensate shall be collected and reused
onsite for applications such as, but not limited to, water features, fountains, green roofs, graywater collection systems
and rainwater collection systems

**703.5 Heat exchangers. Once-through cooling shall be pro-**
hibited. Heat exchangers shall be connected to a recirculating
water system such as a chilled water loop, cooling tower loop
or similar recirculating system.

**703.6 [Reserved]**

**703.7 Cooling towers, evaporative condensers and fluid**
**coolers. Cooling towers, evaporative condensers, and fluid**
coolers shall be installed in accordance with the requirements
of Section 908 of the Mechanical Code.

**703.7.1 Location. Cooling towers, evaporative condensers**
and fluid coolers shall be located on the property as
required for buildings in accordance with the Building
_Code and shall be located so as to prevent the discharge_
vapor plumes from entering occupied spaces. Plume discharges shall be not less than 5 feet (1524 mm) above and
20 feet (6096 mm) away from any ventilation inlet to a
building.
**703.7.2 Once-through cooling. The use of potable water**
for once-through or single-pass cooling operations is prohibited.


**703.7.3 Metering. The metering of mechanical systems,**
system components, equipment and appliances shall be
conducted in accordance with Section 705.1.

**703.7.4 Controllers and alarms. Cooling towers, evapo-**
rative condensers, and fluid coolers shall be equipped with
conductivity controllers and overflow alarms.

**703.7.5 [Reserved]**

**703.7.6 Water quality. Where nonpotable water is used**
within cooling towers, evaporative condensers and fluid
coolers, it shall conform to the water quality and treatment
requirements of the jurisdiction having authority and the
water chemistry guidelines recommended by the equipment manufacturers.

**703.7.7 Discharge. The discharge water from cooling**
towers used for air-conditioning systems shall be in compliance with Table 703.7.7. Where the discharge water is
not captured for reuse, it shall be discharged and treated in
accordance with jurisdictional requirements, if applicable.

**Exception: Discharge water with total dissolved solids**
in excess of 1,500 ppm (1,500 mg/L), or silica in excess
of 120 ppm (120 mg/L) measured as silicon dioxide
shall not be required to meet the minimum parameters
specified in Table 703.7.7.

**703.8 [Reserved]**

**703.9 Evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling systems**
shall use less than 4 gallons of water per ton-hour (12 L per
kWh) of cooling capacity when system controls are set to the
maximum water use. The amount of water use shall be
expressed in maximum water use per ton-hour (kWh) of cooling capacity and shall be marked on the equipment, included
in product user manuals, included in product information literature and included in manufacturer’s instructions. Water
use information shall be readily available at the time of code
compliance inspection.
**703.9.1 Overflow alarm. Cooling systems shall be**
equipped with an overflow alarm to alert building owners,
tenants or maintenance personnel when the water refill
valve continues to allow water to flow into the reservoir
when the reservoir is full. The alarm shall have a minimum sound pressure level rating of 85 dB measured at a
distance of 10 feet (3048 mm).

**703.9.2 Automatic pump shutoff. Cooling systems shall**
automatically cease pumping water to the evaporation
pads when sensible heat reduction is not needed.

**703.9.3 Cooler reservoir discharge. A water quality**
management system such as a timer or water quality sensor shall be required. Where timers are used, the time
