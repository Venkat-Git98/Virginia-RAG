## CHAPTER 4

# SITE DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE


**SECTION 401**
**GENERAL**
**401.1 Scope and intent. This chapter provides requirements**
for the development and maintenance of building and building sites to minimize negative environmental impacts and to
protect, restore and enhance the natural features and environmental quality of the site.

**401.2 Predesign site inventory and assessment. An inven-**
tory and assessment of the natural resources and baseline
conditions of the building site shall be submitted with the
_construction documents. The inventory and assessment shall:_

1. Identify how soils will be prepared, amended and
placed in a manner that establishes or restores the ability of the soil to support the vegetation that has been
protected and that will be planted;

2. Identify invasive plant species on the site for removal;
and

3. Identify native plant species on the site.

**SECTION 404**
**LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION AND OUTDOOR**
**FOUNTAINS**
**404.1 Landscape irrigation systems. Irrigation of exterior**
landscaping shall comply with Sections 404.1.1 and 404.1.2.

**Exception: Projects under the jurisdiction of the Residen-**
_tial Code._

**404.1.1 Water for outdoor landscape irrigation. Out-**
door landscape irrigation systems shall be designed and
installed to reduce potable water use by 50 percent through
plant selection, water efficient irrigation technology, the
elimination of a permanently installed irrigation system,
and/or, where permitted by District regulation or ordinances, with alternate onsite nonpotable water complying
with Section 1115 of the Plumbing Code and local regulations. Designers shall use the EPA Water Sense Interactive
Water Budget Tool to determine whether the design meets
the 50 percent reduction threshold.

**Exceptions:** _Potable water is permitted to be used as_
follows:

1. During the establishment phase of newly planted
landscaping and during periods of drought in
excess of 30 days.


2. To irrigate food production.

3. To supplement _nonpotable water irrigation of_
shade trees provided in accordance with Section
408.2.3 of the Green Construction Code.
**404.1.2 Irrigation system design and installation.**
Where in-ground irrigation systems are provided, the systems shall comply with all of the following:

1. The design and installation of outdoor irrigation systems shall be under the supervision of an irrigation
professional accredited or certified by an appropriate
local or national body.

2. Landscape irrigation systems shall not direct water
onto building exterior surfaces, foundations or exterior paved surfaces. Systems shall not generate runoff.

3. Where an irrigation control system is used, the system shall be one that regulates irrigation based on
weather, climate or soil moisture data, or time of
day. The controller shall have integrated or separate
sensors to suspend irrigation events during rainfall.

4. Irrigation zones shall be based on plant water needs
with plants of similar need grouped together. Turfgrass shall not be grouped with other plantings on
the same zone.

**404.2 [Reserved]**

**SECTION 405**
**MANAGEMENT OF VEGETATION, SOILS AND**
**EROSION CONTROL**
**405.1 Soil and water quality protection. Soil and water**
quality shall be protected in accordance with Sections 405.1.1
and 405.1.4.

**405.1.1 Soil and water quality protection plan. A soil**
and water quality protection plan shall be submitted by the
owner or the owner’s authorized agent and approved prior
to construction. The protection plan shall address the following:

1. A soils map, site plan, or grading plan that indicates
designated soil management areas for all site soils,
including, but not limited to:

1.1. Soils that will be retained in place and designated as vegetation and soil protection
areas.

1.2. Topsoils that will be stockpiled for future
reuse and the locations for the stockpiles.

1.3. Soils that will be disturbed during construction and plans to restore disturbed
soils and underlying subsoils to soil reference conditions.


-----



1.4. Soils that will be restored and re-vegetated.

1.5. Locations for all laydown and storage
areas, parking areas, haul roads and construction vehicle access, temporary utilities
and construction trailer locations.
1.6. Treatment details for each zone of soil that
will be restored, including the type, source
and expected volume of materials, including compost amendments, mulch and topsoil.

1.7. A narrative of the measures to be taken to
ensure that areas not to be disturbed and
areas of restored soils are protected from
compaction by vehicle traffic or storage,
erosion, and contamination until project
completion.
2. A written periodic maintenance protocol for landscaping, including, but not limited to:

2.1. A schedule for periodic watering of new planting that reflects different water needs during the
establishment phase of new plantings as well as
after establishment. Where development of the
building site changed the amount of water
reaching the preserved natural resource areas,
include appropriate measures for maintaining
the natural areas.

2.2. A schedule for the use of fertilizers appropriate
to the plants species, local climate and the preestablishment and post-establishment needs of
the installed landscaping. Nonorganic fertilizers
shall be discontinued following plant establishment.
**405.1.2 [Reserved]**

**405.1.3** **[Reserved]**

**405.1.4 Soil reuse and restoration. Soils that are being**
placed or replaced on a _building site shall be prepared,_
amended and placed in a manner that establishes or
restores the ability of the soil to support the vegetation that
has been protected and that will be planted. Soil reuse and
restoration shall be in accordance with Sections 405.1.4.1
and 405.1.4.2.

**405.1.4.1 Preparation. Before placing stockpiled or**
imported topsoils, compliance with all of the following
shall occur:
1. Areas shall be cleared of debris including, but not
limited to, building materials, plaster, paints, road
base type materials, petroleum based chemicals,
and other harmful materials;

2. Areas of construction-compacted subsoil shall be
scarified; and


3. The first lift of replaced soil shall be mixed into
this scarification zone to improve the transition
between the subsoil and overlying soil horizons.

**Exceptions: Scarification is prohibited in all**
of the following locations:
1. Where scarification would damage
existing tree roots.

2. On inaccessible slopes.

3. On or adjacent to trenching and drainage
installations.

4. On areas intended by the design to be
compacted such as abutments, footings,
and inslopes.

5. Brownfields.

6. Other locations where scarification
would damage existing structures, utilities and vegetation being preserved.
**405.1.4.2 Restoration. Soils disturbed during construc-**
tion shall be restored in areas that will not be covered
by buildings, structures or hardscapes. Soil restoration
shall comply with Items 1 and 2:

1. Organic matter. To provide appropriate organic
matter for plant growth and for water storage and
infiltration, soils shall be amended with a mature,
stable compost material so that not less than the
top 12 inches (305 mm) of soil contains not less
than 3 percent organic matter. Sphagnum peat or
organic amendments that contain sphagnum peat
shall not be used. Soil organic matter shall be
determined in accordance with ASTM D2974.
Organic materials selected for onsite amendment
or for blending of imported soils shall be renewable within a 50-year cycle.

**Exception: Where the reference soil for a**
building site has an organic level depth other
than 12 inches (305 mm), soils shall be
amended to organic matter levels and organic
matter depth that are comparable to the site’s
reference soil.

2. Additional soil restoration criteria. In addition
to compliance with Item 1 Organic Matter, soil
restoration shall comply with not less than three
of the following criteria:

2.1. Compaction. Bulk densities within the
root zone shall not exceed the densities
specified in Table 405.1.4 and shall be
measured using a soil cone penetrometer
in accordance with ASAE S313.3. The
root zone shall be not less than 12 inches
(305 mm), nor less than the site’s reference soil, whichever results in the greater
depth of measurement. Data derived from
