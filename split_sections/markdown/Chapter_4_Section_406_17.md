a soil cone penetrometer shall be reported
in accordance with ASAE EP542.

2.2. Infiltration rates. Infiltration rates or saturated hydraulic conductivity of the
restored soils shall be comparable to the
site’s reference soil. Infiltration rates shall
be determined in accordance with ASTM
D3385 or ASTM D5093. For sloped areas
where the methods provided in the referenced standards cannot be used successfully, alternative methods _approved by_
the _code official shall be permitted pro-_
vided that the same method is used to test
both reference soil and onsite soil.

2.3. Soil biological function. Where remediated soils are used, the biological function
of the soils’ mineralizable nitrogen shall
be permitted as a proxy assessment of
biological activity.

2.4. Soil **chemical** **characteristics.** Soil
chemical characteristics appropriate for
plant growth shall be restored. The pH,
cation exchange capacity and nutrient
profiles of the original undisturbed soil or
the site’s reference soil shall be similar in
restored soils. Salinity suitable for regionally appropriate vegetation shall be established. Soil amendments and fertilizers
shall be selected from those which minimize nutrient loading to waterways or
groundwater.

includes rock, trees, stumps and associated vegetation. The
building site development shall comply with the following
additional requirements:

1. The effective destruction and disposal of invasive plant
_species._

2. Where the site is located in a federal or state designated
quarantine zone for invasive insect species, building
site vegetation management shall comply with the
quarantine rules.

3. Receipts or other documentation related to diversion
shall be maintained through the course of construction.
When requested by the code official, evidence of diversion shall be provided.
**406.2 Construction waste. Construction materials and waste**
and hardscape materials removed during site preparation
shall be managed in accordance with Section 503.

**406.3 Verification. Prior to issuance of the first certificate of**
occupancy for occupiable space in a story above grade plane,
or prior to final inspection, if a new certificate of occupancy
is not required, the _Department is authorized to require the_
_owner, contractor or an approved agency to provide verifica-_
tion of the project’s compliance with Section 406.1.

**407.4 Preferred vehicle parking. Preferred parking spaces**
required by this section shall be those in the parking facility
that are located on the shortest route of travel from the parking facility to a building entrance, but shall not take precedence over parking spaces that are required to be accessible
in accordance with the Building Code. Where buildings have
multiple entrances with adjacent parking, parking spaces
required by this section shall be dispersed and located near
the entrances. Such parking spaces shall be provided with
approved signage that specifies the permitted usage. Parking
spaces equipped with electric vehicle supply equipment will
be considered preferred vehicle parking locations for purposes of this requirement.

**407.4.1 Low-emission, hybrid, and electric vehicle**
**parking. Where parking is provided for a building that has**
a total building floor area greater than 10,000 square feet
(929 m[2]) and that has a building occupant load greater than
300, at least 5 percent of the parking spaces provided, but
