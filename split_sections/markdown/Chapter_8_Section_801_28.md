## CHAPTER 8

# INDOOR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND COMFORT


**SECTION 801**
**GENERAL**
**801.1 Scope and intent. The provisions of this chapter are**
intended to provide an interior environment that is conducive
to the health of building occupants.

**801.2 Demolition and construction phase indoor air qual-**
**ity management plan required. An indoor air quality man-**
agement plan shall be developed and submitted with permit
application materials. Such plan shall address the methods
and procedures to be used during design and construction to
obtain compliance with Sections 802 through 805.

**SECTION 802**
**BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FEATURES,**
**OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FACILITATION**
**802.1 Scope. To facilitate the operation and maintenance of**
the completed building, the building and its systems shall
comply with the requirements of Sections 802.2 and 802.3.

**802.2 Air-handling system access. The arrangement and**
location of air-handling system components including, but
not limited to, ducts, air handler units, fans, coils and condensate pans, shall allow access for cleaning and repair of the airhandling surfaces of such components. Access ports shall be
installed in the air-handling system to permit such cleaning
and repairs. Piping, conduits, and other building components
shall not be located so as to obstruct the required access ports.
**802.3 Air-handling system filters. Filter racks shall be**
designed to prevent airflow from bypassing filters. Access
doors and panels provided for filter replacement shall be fitted with flexible seals to provide an effective seal between
the doors and panels and the mating filter rack surfaces. Filter
access panels and doors shall not be obstructed.

**SECTION 803**
**HVAC SYSTEMS**
**803.1 Construction phase requirements. The ventilation of**
buildings during the construction phase shall be in accordance with Sections 803.1.1 through 803.1.3.

**803.1.1 Duct openings. Duct and other related air distri-**
bution component openings shall be covered with tape,
plastic, sheet metal or shall be closed by an _approved_
method to reduce the amount of dust and debris that collects in the system from the time of rough-in installation
and until startup of the heating and cooling equipment.
Dust and debris shall be cleaned from duct openings prior
to system flush out and building occupancy.


**803.1.2 Indoor air quality during construction. Tempo-**
rary ventilation during construction shall be provided in
accordance with Sections 803.1.2.1 through 803.1.2.3.

**803.1.2.1 Ventilation. Ventilation during construction**
shall be achieved through openings in the building
envelope using one or more of the following methods:

1. Natural ventilation in accordance with the provisions of the _Building Code or the Mechanical_
_Code._
2. Fans that produce a minimum of three air
changes per hour.

3. Exhaust in the work area at a rate of not less than
0.05 cfm/ft2 (0.24 L/s/in2) and not less than 10
percent greater than the supply air rate so as to
maintain negative pressurization of the space.

**Exception: For interior tenant alterations that cannot**
meet ventilation requirements, other air quality measures shall be used to control emissions sources and
improve air quality. Measures are allowed to include
portable filtration units, sweeping compounds, point
source filtration at cutting and grinding operations, vacuum drywall sanding, low-dust drywall compounds,
and other measures acceptable to the code official and
as outlined in the Construction Phase Indoor Air Quality Management Plan.

**803.1.2.2 Protection of HVAC system openings.**
HVAC supply and return duct and equipment openings
shall be protected during dust-producing operations.
**803.1.2.3 Return air filters. Where a forced air HVAC**
system is used during construction, new return air filters shall be installed prior to system flush out and
building occupancy.
**803.1.3 Construction phase ductless system or filter.**
Where spaces are conditioned during the construction
phase, space conditioning systems shall be of the ductless
variety, or filters for ducted systems shall be rated at
MERV 8 or higher in accordance with ASHRAE 52.2, and
system equipment shall be designed to be compatible.
Duct system design shall account for pressure drop across
the filter.

**803.2 [Reserved]**

**803.3 [Reserved]**
**803.4 Isolation of pollutant sources. The isolation of pollut-**
ant sources related to print, copy and janitorial rooms shall be
in accordance with Section 803.4.1.

**803.4.1 Printer, copier and janitorial rooms. Enclosed**
rooms or spaces that are used primarily as a print or copy
