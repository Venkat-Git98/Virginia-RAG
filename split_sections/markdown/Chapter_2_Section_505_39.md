opment of a building site on which an existing building is
already located and in which not less than 75 percent of the
existing core and shell of the structure will be reused shall be
recognized as a project elective.

**A105.7 Historic building reuse project elective. The devel-**
opment of a building site on which an existing building is
already located and in which not less than 75 percent of the
existing core and shell of a locally or nationally designated
historic structure will be reused shall be recognized as a project elective.

**A105.8 Deconstruction project electives. Projects seeking a**
_deconstruction project elective shall comply with Section_
503.1 and this section. Buildings, structures or portions
thereof that are to be demolished shall be systematically disassembled by means of deconstruction. Deconstruction must

**SECTION A106**
**ENERGY CONSERVATION, EFFICIENCY AND**
**EARTH ATMOSPHERIC QUALITY**
**A106.1 zEPI reduction project electives. Project electives**
using zEPI reductions for buildings designed on a performance basis shall be determined by predictive modeling. Predictive modeling shall use a source energy kBtu/sf-y unit
measure based on compliance with Sections A106.1.1 and
A106.1.2. Where a building has mixed uses, all uses shall be
included in the performance based compliance.

**A106.1.1 zEPI. Performance-based designs shall be deter-**
mined in accordance with Equation A106-1 for energy use
reduction:

zEPI = 75  (EUIp/EUI) **(Equation A106-1)**
where:
EUIp = the proposed energy use index in source kBtu/sf-y
for the proposed design of the building and its site calculated in accordance with Section A106.1.2.

EUI = the base annual energy use index in source kBtu/sfy for a baseline building and its site calculated in accordance with Appendix G of the Energy Conservation Code.

**A106.1.2 Base annual energy use index.** The proposed
energy use index (EUIp) of the building and building site
shall be calculated in accordance with Appendix G of the
_Energy Conservation Code, and_ _approved_ modeling guidelines. The annual energy use shall include all energy used for
building functions and its anticipated occupancy.
**A106.1.2.1 Electric power.** In calculating the annual
energy use index, consistent units shall be used for electric energy by converting the electric power use at the
utility meter or measured point of delivery to Btus and
multiplying by the conversion factor in Table A106.1.2.1
based on the geographical location of the building.

**A106.1.2.2 Non-renewable energy.** In calculating the
annual energy use index, for fuel other than electrical


power, energy use shall be converted to consistent units by
multiplying the non-renewable energy fossil fuel use at the
utility meter or measured point of delivery to Btus and
multiplying by the conversion factor in Table A106.1.2.2.

of the Sections A106.2.2 through A106.2.6.

**A106.2.1 Prescriptive path. The building shall be**
designed prescriptively in accordance with the _Energy_
_Conservation Code._

**A106.2.2 Heating equipment. For heating equipment, the**
part-load, full load, annual, or season efficiency of the
equipment shall be not less than 10 percent greater than
the part-load, full load, annual, or season efficiencies
shown in the applicable tables of the Energy Conservation
_Code, or the equipment shall be ENERGY STAR labeled,_
as applicable. Grid-interactive electric thermal storage
heating systems shall be deemed to meet the requisites of
this section where they are directly regulated by the grid
operator to store energy during off-peak hours to utilize
available renewable energy or to provide balancing services for management of the grid.

**A106.2.3 Cooling equipment. For cooling equipment, the**
part-load, full-load, annual, or season efficiency of the
equipment shall be not less than 10 percent greater than
the part-load, full load, annual, or season efficiencies
shown in the applicable tables of the Energy Conservation
_Code, or the equipment shall be ENERGY STAR labeled._
Cooling equipment compressors shall have at least twostage operation if available for the size of the equipment.

**A106.2.4 Supply and return duct insulation. Ducts shall**
be insulated to R-8 or greater where located in unconditioned spaces and R-11 or greater where located outside of
the building structure. Where located within a building
envelope assembly, the duct or plenum shall be separated
from the building exterior or unconditioned or exempt
spaces by R-8 insulation or greater. To qualify for this elective, there must be a minimum of 1 linear foot (304.8 mm)
of applicable supply air ducting per 50 square feet (4.64 m[2])
of building area for ducts 600 CFM or less, or 1 linear foot
(304.8 mm) of applicable ductwork per 200 square feet
(18.6 m[2]) of building area for ducts supplying greater than
600 CFM.
