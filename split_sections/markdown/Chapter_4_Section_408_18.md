**HEAT ISLAND MITIGATION**
**408.1 General. The heat island effect of building and build-**
ing site development shall be mitigated in accordance with
Sections 408.2.
**408.2 Site hardscape. In climate zones 1 through 6, as estab-**
lished in the Energy Conservation Code, not less than 50 percent of the site hardscape shall be provided with one or any
combination of options described in Sections 408.2.1 through
408.2.4. For the purposes of this section, site hardscape shall
not include areas of the site covered by solar photovoltaic
arrays or solar thermal collectors.

**408.2.1 Site hardscape materials. Hardscape materials**
shall have an initial solar reflectance value of not less than
0.30 in accordance with ASTM E1918 or ASTM C1549.

**Exception: The following materials shall be deemed to**
comply with this section and need not be tested:
1. Pervious and permeable concrete pavements.

2. Concrete paving without added color or stain.
**408.2.2 Shading by structures. Where shading is pro-**
vided by a building or structure or a building element or
component, such building, structure, component or element shall comply with all of the following:

1. Where open trellis-type, free-standing structures
such as, but not limited to, covered walkways, and
trellises or pergolas, are covered with native plantings, the plantings shall be designed to achieve
mature coverage within 5 years; and

2. Shade provided onto the hardscape by an adjacent
building or structure located on the same lot shall be
calculated and credited toward compliance with this
section based on the projected peak sun angle on the
summer solstice.

**408.2.3 Shading by trees. Where shading is provided by**
trees, such trees shall be selected and placed in accordance
with all of the following:

1. Trees selected shall be those that are native or adaptive to, the region and climate zone in which the
project site is located. _Invasive plant species shall_
not be selected. Plantings shall be selected and sited
to produce a hardy and drought resistant vegetated
area;

2. Construction documents shall be submitted that
show the planting location and anticipated ten year
canopy growth of trees and that show the contributions of existing tree canopies; and
3. Shading calculations shall be shown on the construction documents demonstrating compliance with
this section and shall include only those hardscape
areas directly beneath the trees based on a ten year
growth canopy. Duplicate shading credit shall not be


granted for those areas where multiple trees shade
the same hardscape.

**408.2.4 Pervious and permeable pavement. Pervious**
and permeable pavements including open grid paving systems and open-graded aggregate systems shall have a percolation rate not less than 2 gallons per minute per square
foot (100 L/min ï‚´ m[2]). Pervious and permeable pavement
shall be permitted where the use of these types of hardscapes does not interfere with fire and emergency apparatus or vehicle or personnel access and egress, utilities, or
telecommunications lines. Aggregate used shall be of uniform size.

**SECTION 409**
**SITE LIGHTING**
**409.1 Light pollution control. Uplight, light trespass, glare,**
and color temperature shall be limited for all exterior lighting
equipment as described in Sections 409.2, 409.3, and 409.4.
The provisions of this section shall only apply to new construction and Level 3 alterations complying with the applicable requirements of the Existing Building Code.

5. Athletic playing areas where lighting is equipped
with hoods or louvers for glare control, provided
that they are fully shielded and emit no light above
the horizontal plane of the hood.

6. Temporary lighting.

7. Lighting for industrial production, material handling, transportation sites, and associated storage
areas where lighting is equipped with hoods or
louvers for glare control, provided that they are
fully shielded and emit no light above the horizontal plane of the hood.
8. Theme elements in theme and amusement parks.

9. Roadway lighting required by governmental
authorities.

10. Lighting used to highlight features of public monuments and registered landmark structures.
