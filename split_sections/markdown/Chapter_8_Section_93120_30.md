# 806.1.2 Emissions from composite wood products. Composite wood products used interior to the approved weather covering of the building shall comply with the


# emission limits cited in Table 806.1.2. Compliance with emission limits shall be demonstrated following the requirements of Section 93120 of Title 17, California Code of Regulations.
 Exceptions:
 1. Composite wood products that are made using adhe- sives that do not contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins.

 2. Composite wood products that are sealed with an impermeable material on all sides and edges.

 3. Composite wood products that are used to make ele- ments considered to be furniture, fixtures and equip- ment (FF&E) that are not permanently installed.

a. Maximum thickness of [5]/16 inch (8 mm).
b. Phase 2 Formaldehyde Emissions Standards, Table 1, Section 93120, Title
17, California Code of Regulations; compliance shall be demonstrated in
accordance with ASTM D6007 or ASTM E1333.
# 806.1.3 Adhesives and sealants. A minimum of 85 per- cent by weight or volume, of specific categories of site- applied adhesives and sealants used on the interior side of the building envelope, shall comply with the VOC content limits in Table 806.1.3(1) or alternative VOC emission limits in Table 806.1.3(2). The VOC content shall be determined in accordance with the appropriate standard being either U.S. EPA Method 24 or SCAQMD Method 304, 316A or 316B. The exempt compound content shall be determined by either SCAQMD Methods 302 and 303 or ASTM D3960. Table 806.1.3(1) adhesives and sealants regulatory category and VOC content compliance determi- nation shall conform to the SCAQMD Rule 1168. The provisions of this section shall not apply to adhesives and sealants subject to state or federal consumer product VOC regulations. HVAC duct sealants shall be classified as “Other” category within the SCAQMD Rule 1168 sealants table.
 Exception: HVAC air duct sealants are not required to meet the emissions or the VOC content requirements when the air temperature in which they are applied is less than 40°F (4.5°C). Table 806.1.3(2) adhesive alternative emissions stan- dards compliance shall be determined utilizing test meth- odology incorporated by reference in the CDPH/EHLB/ Standard Method V.1.1. The alternative emissions testing shall be performed by a laboratory that has the CDPH/ EHLB/Standard Method V.1.1 test methodology in the scope of its ISO 17025 Accreditation.
