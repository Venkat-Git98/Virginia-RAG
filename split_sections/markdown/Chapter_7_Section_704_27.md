interval between the discharge events of the water reservoir shall be set to 6 hours or greater of cooler operation.
Continuous discharge or continuous bleed systems shall be
prohibited.

**703.9.4 Discharge water reuse. Discharge water shall be**
reused where appropriate applications exist on site. Where
a nonpotable water source system exists on site, evaporative cooler discharge water shall be collected and discharged to such collection system.
**Exception: Where the reservoir water will adversely**
affect the quality of the nonpotable water supply making the nonpotable water unusable for its intended purposes.
**703.9.5 Discharge water to drain. Where discharge**
water is not required to be recovered for reuse, the sump
overflow pipe shall not directly connect to a drain. Where
the discharge water is discharged into a sanitary drain, an
air gap of not less than 6 inches (150 mm) shall be
required between the termination of the discharge pipe and
the drain opening. The discharge pipe shall terminate in a
location that is readily visible to the building owners, tenants or maintenance personnel.

**SECTION 704**
**WATER TREATMENT DEVICES AND EQUIPMENT**
**704.1 Water softeners. Water softeners shall comply with**
Sections 704.1.1 through 704.1.4.

**704.1.1 Demand-initiated regeneration. Water softeners**
shall be equipped with demand-initiated regeneration control systems. Such control systems shall automatically initiate the regeneration cycle after determining the
depletion, or impending depletion of softening capacity.

**704.1.2 Water consumption. Water softeners shall have a**
maximum water consumption during regeneration of 5
gallons (18.9 L) per 1000 grains (17.1 g/L) of hardness
removed as measured in accordance with NSF 44.

**704.1.3 Waste connections. Waste water from water soft-**
ener regeneration shall not discharge to reclaimed water
collection systems and shall discharge in accordance with
the Plumbing Code.

**704.1.4 Efficiency and listing. Water softeners that**
regenerate in place, that are connected to the water system
they serve by piping not exceeding 1[1]/4 inches (31.8 mm)
in diameter, or that have a volume of 3 cubic feet (0.085
m[3]) or more of cation exchange media shall have a rated
salt efficiency of not less than 4,000 grains of total hardness exchange per pound of salt (571 g of total hardness
exchange per kg of salt), based on sodium chloride equivalency and shall be listed and labeled in accordance with
NSF 44. All other water softeners shall have a rated salt
efficiency of not less than 3,000 grains of total hardness
exchange per pound of salt (429 g of total hardness
exchange per kg of salt), based on sodium chloride equivalency.


**704.2 Reverse osmosis water treatment systems. Point-of-**
use reverse osmosis treatment systems shall be listed and
labeled in accordance with NSF 58. Point-of-use reverse
osmosis systems shall be equipped with an automatic shutoff
valve that prevents the production of reject water when there
is no demand for treated water.

**704.3 Onsite reclaimed water treatment systems. Onsite**
reclaimed water treatment systems shall be listed and labeled
to NSF 350. These systems shall include gray water, rainwater, and other nonpotable water reuse treatment systems and
waste water treatment systems used to produce nonpotable
water for water closet and urinal flushing, surface irrigation
and similar applications.

**SECTION 705**
**METERING**
**705.1 Metering. Water consumed from any source associ-**
ated with the building or building site shall be metered. Each
potable and reclaimed source of water, and each onsite nonpotable water source, shall be metered separately. Meters
shall be installed in accordance with the requirements of the
_Plumbing Code. For the purposes of Section 705.1.1, each_
meter identified in Table 705.1.1 shall be capable of communicating water consumption data remotely and at a minimum,
be capable of providing daily data with electronic data storage and reporting capability that can produce reports that
show daily, monthly, and annual water consumption.
**705.1.1 Metering. All potable and nonpotable water sup-**
plied to the applications listed in Table 705.1.1 shall be
individually metered in accordance with the requirements
indicated in Table 705.1.1. Similar appliances and equipment shall be permitted to be grouped and supplied from
piping connected to a single meter.
