## CHAPTER 7

# WATER RESOURCE CONSERVATION, QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY


**SECTION 701**
**GENERAL**
**701.1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall establish the**
means of conserving water, protecting water quality and providing for safe water consumption.

**SECTION 702**
**FIXTURES, FITTINGS, EQUIPMENT AND**
**APPLIANCES**
**702.1 Fitting and fixture consumption. Fixtures shall com-**
ply with Table 702.1.

**TABLE 702.1**
**MAXIMUM FIXTURE AND FITTING FLOW RATES**
**FOR REDUCED WATER CONSUMPTION**

**FIXTURE OR FIXTURE FITTING TYPE** **MAXIMUM FLOW RATE**

2.0 gpm and
Showerhead[a]
WaterSense labeled

1.5 gpm and
Lavatory faucet and bar sink—private
WaterSense labeled
Lavatory faucet—public (metered) 0.25 gpc[b]

Lavatory faucet—public (nonmetered) 0.5 gpm
Kitchen faucet—private 1.8 gpm
Kitchen and bar sink faucets in other
1.8 gpm
than dwelling units and guestrooms

0.5 gpf and WaterSense
Urinal
labeled or nonwater urinal
Water closet—public 1.28 gpf average[c]

1.28 gpf and
Water closet—tank type, private
WaterSense labeled[c]

Water closet—flushometer type,
1.28 gpf
private

1.3 gpm and
Prerinse spray valves
WaterSense labeled
Drinking fountains (manual) 0.7 gpm
Drinking fountains (metered) 0.25 gpc[b]

For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 gallon per cycle (gpc) = 3.8 Lpc, 1 gallon per
flush (gpf) = 3.8 Lpf, 1 gallon per minute (gpm) = 3.8 Lpm.
a. Includes hand showers, body sprays, rainfall panels and jets. Showerheads
shall be supplied by automatic compensating valves that comply with
ASSE 1016 or ASME A112.18.1/CSA B125.1 and that are specifically
designed to function at the flow rate of the showerheads being used.
b. Gallons per cycle of water volume discharged from each activation of a
metered faucet.
c. The effective flush volume for a dual-flush water closet is defined as the
composite, average flush volume of two reduced flushes and one full
flush.

**702.2 Combination tub and shower valves. Tub spout leak-**
age from combination tub and shower valves that occurs
when the outlet flow is diverted to the shower shall not
exceed 0.1 gpm, measured in accordance with the requirements of ASME A112.18.1/CSA B125.1.


**702.3 Food establishment prerinse spray valves. Food**
establishment prerinse spray valves shall have a maximum
flow rate in accordance with Table 702.1 and shall shut off
automatically when released.

**702.4 Drinking fountain controls. Drinking fountains**
equipped with manually controlled valves shall shut off automatically upon the release of the valve. Metered drinking
fountains shall comply with the flow volume specified in
Table 702.1.

**702.5 Nonwater urinal connection. The fixture drain for**
nonwater urinals shall connect to a branch drain that serves
one or more lavatories, water closets or water-using urinals
that discharge upstream of such urinals.
**702.6 Appliances. Sections 702.6.1 through 702.6.4 shall**
regulate appliances that are not related to space conditioning.

**702.6.1 Clothes washers. Clothes washers of the type in**
the ENERGY STAR program as defined in “ENERGY
STAR Program Requirements, Product Specification for
Clothes Washers, Eligibility Criteria,” shall have a water
factor (WF) not exceeding 6.0 and a modified energy fac_tor (MEF) of not less than 2.0._

**702.6.2 Ice makers. Ice makers producing cubed-type ice**
shall be ENERGY STAR qualified as commercial ice
machines. Ice makers of a type not currently ENERGY
STAR qualified, such as flake, nugget or continuous-type
ice makers, shall not exceed the total water use of 25 gallons per 100 pounds (208 L per 100 kg) of ice produced.

**Exception: Under counter ice makers.**
**702.6.3 Steam cookers. Steam cookers with drain connec-**
tions shall consume no more than 5 gal (18.9 L)/hour/pan,
and those without drain connections shall consume no
more than 2 gal (7.6 L)/hour/pan.
**702.6.4 Dishwashers. Dishwashers shall be ENERGY**
STAR qualified where an ENERGY STAR category exists
for the specific dishwasher type. Where an ENERGY
STAR category does not exist, the dishwasher shall be in
accordance with Table 702.6.4.

**TABLE 702.6.4**
**MAXIMUM WATER CONSUMPTION**
**FOR COMMERCIAL DISHWASHERS**

**DISHWASHER TYPE** **MAXIMUM WATER CONSUMPTION**
Rackless conveyor 2.2 gallons per minute
Utensil washer 2.2 gallons per rack

For SI: 1 gallon per minute = 3.785 Lpm.

**702.7 [Reserved]**

**702.8 Efficient hot and tempered water distribution. Hot**
and tempered water distribution shall comply with either the
maximum pipe length or maximum pipe volume limits in this
section. Hot and tempered water shall be delivered to the outlets of individual showers, combination tub-showers, sinks,
