structure systems, as determined by the jurisdiction, to serve
the demands imposed by a new development on building sites
without negatively impacting services to existing users of the
infrastructure and without negatively impacting the overall
functionality of the infrastructure. Adequacy can be determined based on existing infrastructure or on the infrastructure
as augmented by a development project.

**INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES. Species that are not native**
to the ecosystem under consideration and that cause, or are
likely to cause, economic or environmental harm or harm to
human, animal or plant health, defined by using the best scientific knowledge of that region. Consideration for inclusion
as an invasive species shall include, but shall not be limited
to, those species identified on:

1. Approved city, county or regional lists.

2. State noxious weeds laws,

3. Federal noxious weeds laws.
**JURISDICTION. The governmental unit that has adopted**
this code under due legislative authority.

**LABEL. An identification applied on a product by the manu-**
facturer that contains the name of the manufacturer, the function and performance characteristics of the product or
material, and the name and identification of an approved
agency and that indicates that the representative sample of the
product or material has been tested and evaluated by an
approved agency.

**LABELED. Equipment, materials or products to which has**
been affixed a label, seal, symbol or other identifying mark of
a nationally recognized testing laboratory, inspection agency
or other organization concerned with product evaluation that
maintains periodic inspection of the production of the abovelabeled items and whose labeling indicates either that the
equipment, material or product meets identified standards or
has been tested and found suitable for a specified purpose.

**LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA). A technique to eval-**
uate the relevant energy and material consumed and environmental emissions associated with the entire life of a building,
product, process, material, component, assembly, activity or
service.

**LIGHTING BOUNDARY. Where the lot line abuts a public**
walkway, bikeway, plaza, or parking lot, the lighting bound_ary shall be a line 5 feet (1524 mm) from the lot line and_
located on the public property. Where the lot line abuts a public roadway or public transit corridor, the lighting boundary
shall be the centerline of the public roadway or public transit
corridor. In all other circumstances, the _lighting boundary_
shall be at the lot line.

**LISTED. Equipment, materials, products or services**
included in a list published by an organization acceptable to
the code official and concerned with evaluation of products or


services that maintains periodic inspection of production of
listed equipment or materials or periodic evaluation of services and whose listing states either that the equipment, material, product or service meets identified standards or has been
tested and found suitable for a specified purpose.

**LOT. A portion or parcel of land considered as a unit.**

**LOT LINE. A line dividing one lot from another, or from a**
street or any public place.

**LOW EMISSION, HYBRID AND ELECTRIC VEHI-**
**CLE. Vehicles that achieve EPA Tier 2, California LEV-II,**
or a minimum of EPA LEV standards, whether by means of
hybrid, alternative fuel, or electric power.

**LOW** **VOLTAGE** **DRY-TYPE** **DISTRIBUTION**
**TRANSFORMER. A NEMA ‘Class 1’ transformer that is**
air-cooled, does not use oil as a coolant, has an input voltage
 600 volts, and is rated for operation at a frequency of 60
hertz.

**MANUAL. Capable of being operated by personal interven-**
tion (see “Automatic”).

**MINIMUM** **EFFICIENCY** **REPORTING** **VALUE**
**(MERV). Minimum efficiency-rated value for the effective-**
ness of air filters.

**METER. A measuring device used to collect data and indi-**
cate usage.

**MODIFIED ENERGY FACTOR (MEF). The capacity in**
cubic feet of the clothes container of a clothes washing
machine, C, divided by the clothes washing total energy consumption in kWh per cycle. Total energy consumption per
cycle is the sum of the machine electrical energy consumption per cycle, M; the hot water energy consumption per
cycle, E; and the energy required for removal of the remaining moisture in the wash load per cycle, D. The equation is:

MEF = C/(M + E + D)

**MUNICIPAL RECLAIMED WATER. Reclaimed water**
treated by a municipality.

**NATIVE PLANT SPECIES. Species that are native to the**
ecosystem under consideration, defined by using the best scientific knowledge of that region. Consideration for inclusion
as a native species shall include, but is not limited to, those
species identified in any of the following:

1. Approved city, county and regional lists.

2. State laws.

3. Federal laws.
**NEW CONSTRUCTION (For Section 302). The construc-**
