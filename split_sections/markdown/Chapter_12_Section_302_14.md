Columbia listed in Section 302.4.1.1.2, then the
applicant may elect to have verification of the
_project based upon an earlier version of the_
appropriate standard; provided, that the earliest
version of the appropriate standard that shall be
used is the version in effect one year prior to
whichever of the interactions of the applicant
with the District of Columbia listed in Section
302.4.1.1.2 came first.
**302.5 Verification. Evidence that a project meets or exceeds**
the LEED standard required by Sections 302.2.2 through
302.2.7 or Sections 302.3.2 through 302.3.43, or the Enterprise Green Communities Criteria (or approved substantially
equivalent standard) required by Section 302.2.4, shall be
submitted to the code official within 24 calendar months after
the _projectâ€™s receipt of the first certificate of occupancy_
issued for occupiable space in a story above grade plane.

**302.5.1 Evidence required. For purposes of this section,**
verification of compliance shall be established by the following:

1. A certification by the USGBC that the project meets
or exceeds the applicable LEED standard required
by Sections 302.2.2 through 302.2.7 or Sections
302.3.2 through 302.3.43, or, if applicable, a certification by Enterprise Green Communities (or entity
that certifies an _approved substantially equivalent_
standard) that the project meets or exceeds the applicable standard required by Section 302.2.4; or
2. A determination by the code official that the project
meets or exceeds the LEED standard required by
Sections 302.2.2 through 302.2.7 or Section 302.3.2
through 302.3.4, or the Enterprise Green Communities Criteria (or _approved_ substantially equivalent
standard) required by Section 302.2.4; or

3. A certification by an approved agency or approved
_source that the project meets or exceeds the LEED_
standard required by Sections 302.2.2 through
302.2.7 or Section 302.3.2 through 302.3.4, or the
Enterprise Green Communities Criteria (or
_approved substantially equivalent standard) required_
by Section 302.2.4.

**302.5.2 Extension. The code official, for good cause and**
upon written request, is authorized to extend the period for
verification of compliance for up to three consecutive oneyear periods.

**302.6 Financial security. Before issuance of the first certifi-**
cate of occupancy for occupiable space in a _story above_
_grade plane of a privately-owned project subject to the provi-_
sions of Sections 302.3.2 through 302.3.4, the applicant shall
provide to the code official evidence of financial security to
cover the amount of fine that would be imposed under the
Green Building Act for non-compliance with the provisions
of Sections 302.3.2 through 302.3.4.


**302.6.1 Amount of financial security. The amount of the**
potential fine on a project, and thus the amount of financial security, shall be as follows:

1. $7.50 per square foot of _gross floor area of con-_
struction if the _project is less than 100,000 square_
feet (9290 m[2]) of gross floor area of the project.

2. $10.00 per square foot of _gross floor area of con-_
struction if the _project is equal to or greater than_
100,000 square feet (9290 m[2]) of gross floor area of
the project.

The amount of a fine for non-compliance under this
sub-section, and thus the amount of security, shall not
exceed three million dollars ($3,000,000). When applying
the provisions of this Section 302.6 to interior construction
of a mixed use space in a residential project covered by
Section 302.3.3, the gross floor area of the project shall be
deemed to mean the contiguous _gross floor area, exclu-_
sive of common space, of the non-residential occupancies.
The amount of this fine shall be subject to modification
based upon the form of security for performance as provided for in Sections 302.6.2.1 through 302.6.2.3.

**302.6.2 Security for performance/form of delivery. The**
financial security requirement shall be met through one of
the following four methods:

**302.6.2.1 Cash. If this option is elected, cash shall be**
deposited in an escrow account in a financial institution
in the District in the names of the _applicant and the_
District. A copy of a binding escrow agreement of the
financial institution shall be submitted to the code offi_cial in a form satisfactory to the Office of the Attorney_
General, which provides that the funds can be released
upon direction of the District where remitted pursuant
to Section 302.7. If cash is used as the financial security, the amount of the financial security posted shall be
discounted by 20 percent.

**302.6.2.2 Irrevocable letter of credit. If this option is**
elected, an irrevocable letter of credit benefitting the
District shall be submitted to the code official in a form
satisfactory to the Office of the Attorney General from
a financial institution authorized to do business in the
District. The irrevocable letter of credit, issued by the
financial institution, shall comply with applicable regulatory requirements. If an irrevocable letter of credit is
used as the financial security, the amount of the financial security posted shall be discounted by 20 percent.

**302.6.2.3 Bond. If this option is elected, a bond bene-**
fitting the District, which complies with applicable regulatory requirements, shall be submitted to the _code_
_official in a form satisfactory to the Office of the Attor-_
ney General. If a bond is used as the financial security,
the amount of the financial security posted shall be discounted by 20 percent.
