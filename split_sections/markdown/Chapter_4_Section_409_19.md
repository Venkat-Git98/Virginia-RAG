**[E] TABLE 409.1.1**
**EXTERIOR LIGHTING ZONES**

**LIGHTING ZONE** **DESCRIPTION**

## 1 Developed areas of national parks, state parks, forest land and rural areas

 2 Areas predominantly consisting of residential zoning, neighborhood business districts, light industrial with limited nighttime use and resi- dential mixed use areas

 3 All other areas (not included in other zones)

 4 High-activity commercial districts

# 409.2 Uplight. Exterior lighting shall comply with the requirements of Table 409.2 for the exterior lighting zones (LZ) appropriate to the building site.
 Exception: Lighting used for the following exterior appli- cations shall be exempt from the requirements of Table 409.2.

## Maximum luminaire uplight U0 U1 U2 U3 rating

a. Uplight ratings (U) are defined by IESNA TM-15-07 Addendum A.
b. The rating shall be determined by the actual photometric geometry in the
specified mounting orientation.

# 409.3 Light trespass and glare. Where luminaires are mounted on buildings with their backlight oriented towards the building, such luminaires shall not exceed the applicable glare ratings specified in Table 409.3(1). Other exterior lumi

# naires shall not exceed the applicable backlight and glare rat- ings specified in Table 409.3(2).

a. Backlight (B) and glare (G) ratings are defined by IESNA TM-15-07
Addendum A.
b. Luminaires located two mounting heights or less from the _lighting_
_boundary shall be installed with backlight towards the nearest_ _lighting_
_boundary, unless lighting a roadway, bikeway or walkway that intersects a_
public roadway.
c. The rating shall be determined by the actual photometric geometry in the
specified mounting orientation.
# 409.4 Color temperature. Maximum color temperature for lights complying with Section 409 shall be 3000 degrees Kel- vin or lower.
