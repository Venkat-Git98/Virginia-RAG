The integrated version of the 2017 DC Green Construction Code identifies changes to the 2012
IgCC model code as well as changes from the 2013 _DC Green Construction Code to the 2017_ _DC_
_Green Construction Code. A double vertical line in the margin indicate DC changes to the 2012 IgCC_
model code. A solid vertical line in the margin indicates DC updates from the 2013 DC Green Con_struction Code to the 2017 edition._

A deletion arrow ( ¬ ) is provided in the margin where an entire section, paragraph, exception
or table has been deleted or an item in a list of items or a table has been deleted.

Consistent with prior practice in the District of Columbia, Chapter 1 of the District of Columbia
_Building Code contains administrative and enforcement provisions that apply to all the individual_
codes that comprise the District of Columbia Construction Codes, with the exception of the Property
_Maintenance Code and the Fire Code. Administrative and enforcement provisions for the Property_
_Maintenance Code and the Fire Code are set forth in 12-G DCMR, Chapter 1, and 12-H DCMR, Chap-_
ter 1, respectively.

The 2017 District of Columbia Construction Codes became effective May 29, 2020, and apply to all
new and existing construction and buildings in the District of Columbia, unless otherwise excepted
or excluded, subject to the transition provisions set forth in Section 123 of the Building Code, which
allows continued use of the 2013 Construction Codes under specified circumstances.

The District of Columbia Construction Codes should be cited by referencing the ICC, ASHRAE or NEC
provision if applicable, or the local District of Columbia amendment set forth in 12 DCMR. Alternatively, a specific provision can be cited by referencing the applicable District of Columbia Construction Code, e.g., 2017 District of Columbia Property Maintenance Code, Section 404.1.


## Codes Maintenance

At the national level, the model codes are kept current through the review of proposed changes
submitted to the organizing body by code enforcement officials, industry representatives, design
professionals and other interested parties. Proposed changes are considered through an open code
development process in which all interested and affected parties may participate. New model codes
are issued on a three-year cycle.
