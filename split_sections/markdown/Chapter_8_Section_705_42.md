**A108.5 Architectural paints and coatings project elective.**
Where projects are intended to qualify for an architectural
paints and coatings project elective, 100 percent of the nonspecialty paints and coatings shall have VOC limits that are
more than 50 percent lower than the thresholds in Table
806.4(1) and 100 percent of the specialty coatings shall meet
the requirements in Table 806.4(1).

**A108.6 Views to building exterior project elective. Where**
projects are intended to qualify for a “views to building exterior” project elective in accordance with Section A108.6, not
less than 75 percent of the net floor area shall have a direct
line of sight to the exterior through clear vision glazing. A

glazing in the exterior wall or roof shall be visible. The direct
line of sight shall originate at a height of 42 inches (1067
mm) above the finished floor of the space, shall terminate at
the clear vision glazing in the exterior wall or roof, and shall
be less than 40 feet (12 192 mm) in length. Projects that have
a direct line of sight to the exterior for 90 percent of the net
floor area shall qualify for an additional project elective.

**Exception: Where the direct line of sight is less than 25**
feet (7620 mm) in length, a total of not less than 18 square
feet (1.67 m[2]) of clear vision glazing in the exterior wall or
roof shall be visible.
**A108.7 Post-construction, pre-occupancy baseline IAQ**
**testing project electives. Where projects are intended to**
qualify for these two project electives, after all interior finishes are installed the building shall be tested for indoor air
quality and the testing results shall indicate that the levels of
VOCs are less than 50 percent of all of the levels detailed in
Table 806.1 of the _Green Construction Code using testing_
protocols in accordance with ASTM D6196, ASTM D5466,
ASTM D5197, ASTM D6345, and ISO 7708. Test samples
shall be taken in not less than one location in each 25,000

area.

**A108.8 Adhesives and sealants project elective. Where**
projects are intended to qualify for an adhesives and sealants
project elective, 100 percent of the adhesives and sealants

**A108.9 Post-construction, pre-occupancy flush out. After**
construction ends, and prior to occupancy and with all interior finishes installed, install new filtration media and perform a building flush-out by supplying a total air volume of
14,000 cubic feet of outdoor air per square foot (4,500 cubic
meters of outdoor air per square meter) of floor area while
maintaining an internal temperature of at least 60°F (15°C)
and relative humidity no higher than 60 percent.
