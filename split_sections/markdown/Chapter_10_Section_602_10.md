the sun. SRI compares a surface’s temperature to those of
standard black and standard white surfaces. It typically
ranges from 0 for standard black to 100 for standard white,
but can be less than 0 or greater than 100.

**SOLAR THERMAL EQUIPMENT. A device that uses**
solar radiation to heat water or air for use within the facility
for service water heating, process heat, space heating or space
cooling.

**STANDARD REFERENCE DESIGN. A building design**
that meets the minimum requirements of the Energy Conser_vation Code and the additional requirements of Section_
602.2.

**STANDBY MODE (ELEVATOR). An operating mode**
during periods of inactivity in which electrical loads are
reduced to conserve energy. For elevators, standby mode
begins up to 5 minutes after an elevator is unoccupied and has
parked and completed its last run and ends when the doors are
re-opened. For escalators and moving walkways, standby
mode begins after traffic has been absent for up to 5 minutes
and ends when the next passenger arrives.

**STEAM COOKER. Equipment in which potable steam is**
used for heating, cooking, and reconstituting food.

**STORAGE TANK (GRAYWATER OR RAINWATER).**
A fixed container for holding water at atmospheric pressure
for subsequent use as part of a plumbing or irrigation system.

**STORY. That portion of a building included between the**
upper surface of a floor and the upper surface of the floor or
roof next above. It is measured as the vertical distance from
top to top of two successive tiers of beams or finished floor
surfaces and, for the topmost story, from the top of the floor
finish to the top of the ceiling joists or, where there is not a
ceiling, to the top of the roof rafters.

**STRUCTURE. That which is built or constructed.**

**SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any repair, recon-**
struction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the
improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained
substantial damage, any repairs are considered _substantial_
_improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed._
The term does not include either of the following:

1. Any project for improvement of a building required to
correct existing health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the _code official and that are the_
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.

2. Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure.
**SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT (For Section 302).**
Any repair, alteration, or addition of a building or structure,
the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market
value of the building or structure before the repair, alteration,
or addition is started.

**THERMAL EMITTANCE. The ratio of radiative power**
emitted by a sample to that emitted by a black body radiator
at the same temperature.


**TOPSOIL. The upper, outmost layer of soil having the high-**
est concentration of organic matter and microorganisms and
where the majority of biological soil activity occurs.

**TRACTION ELEVATOR. An elevator system in which the**
cars are suspended by ropes wrapped around a sheave that is
driven by an electric motor.

**TRANSIT SERVICE. A service that a public transit agency**
serving the area has committed to provide including, but not
limited to, bus, streetcar, light or heavy rail, passenger ferry
or tram service.

**TUBULAR DAYLIGHTING DEVICE (TDD). A non-**
operable fenestration unit primarily designed to transmit daylight from a roof surface to an interior space via a tubular
conduit. The basic unit consists of an exterior glazed weathering surface, a light-transmitting tube with a reflective interior
surface, and an interior-sealing device such as a translucent
panel. The unit is either factory assembled, or field assembled
from a manufacturing kit.

**_U-FACTOR (THERMAL TRANSMITTANCE). The_**
coefficient of heat transmission (air to air) through a building
component or assembly, equal to the time rate of heat flow
per unit area and unit temperature difference between the
warm side and cold side air films (Btu/h  ft[2]  F) [W/(m[2] 
K)].

**VEGETATIVE ROOF. An assembly of interacting compo-**
nents designed to waterproof and normally insulate a building’s top surface that includes, by design, vegetation and
related landscaping elements.

**VENTILATION. The natural or mechanical process of sup-**
plying conditioned or unconditioned air to, or removing such
air from, any space.

**VISIBLE TRANSMITTANCE (VT). The ratio of visible**
light entering the space through the fenestration product
assembly to the incident visible light. VT includes the effects
of glazing material and frame and is expressed as a number
between 0 and 1.

**VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC). A volatile**
chemical compound based on carbon chains or rings that typically contain hydrogen and sometimes contain oxygen, nitrogen and other elements, and that has a vapor pressure of
greater than 0.1 mm of mercury at room temperature.

**VOLTAGE DROP. A decrease in voltage caused by losses**
in the circuit conductors connecting the power source to the
load.

**WATER FACTOR (WF). The quantity of water, in gallons**
per cycle (Q), divided by a clothes washing machine clothes
container capacity in cubic feet (C). The equation is:

WF = Q/C

**WATER FEATURE. An outdoor open water installation or**
natural open water way within a built landscape to retain
water supplied from source other than rainwater naturally
flowing into the feature.

**WATERSENSE. A program of the U.S. Environmental Pro-**
tection Agency (EPA) designed to identify and promote
water-efficient products and practices.

**WETLAND. Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface**
or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
conditions.

**ZERO ENERGY PERFORMANCE INDEX (zEPI). A**
scalar representing the ratio of energy performance of the
proposed design compared to the average energy performance of buildings relative to a benchmark year.
