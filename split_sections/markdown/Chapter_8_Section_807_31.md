**TABLE 806.4(1)—continued**
**VOC CONTENT LIMITS FOR ARCHITECTURAL COATINGS[c, d, e]**

d. Values in this table are derived from those specified by the California Air
Resources Board Suggested Control Measure for Architectural Coatings,
dated February 1, 2008.
e. Table 806.4(1) architectural coating regulatory category and VOC content
compliance determination shall conform to the California Air Resources
Board Suggested Control Measure for Architectural Coatings.

Table 806.1.4(2) architectural coating alternate emissions
standards compliance shall be determined utilizing test methodology incorporated by reference in the CDPH/EHLB/ Standard Method V.1.1. The alternative emissions testing shall be
performed by a laboratory that has the CDPH/EHLB/Standard Method V.1.1 test methodology in the scope of its ISO
17025 Accreditation.

**TABLE 806.1.4(2)**
**ARCHITECTURAL COATINGS VOC EMISSION LIMITS**

**VOC** **LIMIT**
Individual  [1]/2 CA chronic REL[a]

Formaldehyde  16.5 g/m[3] or  13.5 ppb[b]

a. CA Chronic Reference Exposure Level (CREL).
b. Formaldehyde emission levels need not be reported for materials where
formaldehyde is not added by the manufacturer of the material.
**806.1.5 Flooring. A minimum of 85 percent of the total**
area of flooring installed within the interior of the building
shall comply with the requirements of Table 806.1.5(2).
Where flooring with more than one distinct product layer
is installed, the emissions from each layer shall comply
with these requirements. The test methodology used to
determine compliance shall be from CDPH/EHLB/Standard Method V.1.1. The emissions testing shall be performed by a laboratory that has the CDPH/EHLB/
Standard Method V.1.1 test methodology in the scope of
its ISO 17025 Accreditation.

Where post-manufacture coatings or surface applications have not been applied, the flooring listed in Table
806.1.5(1) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of Table 806.1.5(2).

**806.1.6 Acoustical ceiling tiles and wall systems. A min-**
imum of 85 percent of acoustical ceiling tiles and wall systems, by area, shall comply with the requirements of Table
806.6(2). Where ceiling and wall systems with more than


one distinct product layer are installed, the emissions from
each layer shall comply with these requirements. The test
methodology used to determine compliance shall be from
CDPH/EHLB/Standard Method V.1.1. The emissions testing shall be performed by a laboratory that has the CDPH/
EHLB/Standard Method V.1.1 test methodology in the
scope of its ISO 17025 Accreditation.

Where post-manufacture coatings or surface applications have not been applied, the ceiling or wall systems
listed in Table 806.6(1) shall be deemed to comply with
the requirements of Table 806.6(2).
